## Section 2: Aerial Scientific Protocols (Mapping Nodes to Procedures)

### Air Dust Sample Collection over N33 Crater
- **Assigned Drone**: Drone_4
- **Trajectory**: Trajectory 1
- **Nodes Visited**: N33
- **Procedure**:
  - Conducted pre-flight checks.
  - Launched from the nearest safe location to N33 crater.
  - Hovered at varying altitudes (e.g., 50m, 100m) to collect dust samples.
  - Monitored environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed).
  - Returned to launch pad and transferred data.

### CO2 Frost Mapping in Icy Areas (N53, N63, N108)
- **Assigned Drones**: Drone_4 and Drone_3
- **Nodes Visited**:
  - Drone_4: N53
  - Drone_3: N108
  - Note: N63 was not covered in the provided trajectories.
- **Procedures**:
  - **Drone_4**:
    - Pre-flight checks and launch from nearest safe location to N53.
    - Activated imaging equipment upon reaching N53.
    - Monitored environmental conditions.
    - Returned to launch pad and transferred data.
  - **Drone_3**:
    - Pre-flight checks and launch from nearest safe location to N108.
    - Activated imaging equipment upon reaching N108.
    - Monitored environmental conditions.
    - Returned to launch pad and transferred data.

## Section 3: Environmental Monitoring Equipment

### Equipment Used
- **Air Dust Sample Collection**:
  - Sampling devices for dust particles.
  - Sensors for temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
  
- **CO2 Frost Mapping**:
  - Imaging equipment for visual data capture.
  - Sensors for environmental conditions.

---

## Section 4: Data Transfer and Analysis

### Data Collected
- **Drone_4**:
  - Dust samples from N33.
  - Visual and environmental data from N53.
  
- **Drone_3**:
  - Visual and environmental data from N108.

### Notes
- N63 was not covered in the provided trajectories, potentially leaving it unmapped.
- Data from all nodes will be analyzed to assess CO2 frost distribution and dust composition.

## Conclusion

This report outlines the operations conducted by Drone_4 and Drone_3 during their respective missions. Drone_4 successfully collected dust samples at N33 and mapped CO2 frost at N53, while Drone_3 focused on mapping CO2 frost at N108. However, N63 remains unmapped due to a gap in the provided trajectories. Future operations should address this oversight to ensure comprehensive data collection across all specified nodes.
