## Section 2: Aerial Scientific Protocols (Mapping Nodes to Procedures)

### Air Dust Sample Collection at N33
- **Assigned Drone**: Drone_0  
- **Protocol**: Conducted over N33 Crater, involving pre-flight checks, takeoff, navigation, hover at 500m, dust sampling at multiple altitudes, data transmission, and return to launch pad.

### CO2 Frost Mapping at N53
- **Assigned Drone**: Drone_2  
- **Protocol**: Pre-flight checks, takeoff, navigation to N53, imaging of CO2 frost, data transmission, and return to launch pad.

### CO2 Frost Mapping at N108
- **Assigned Drone**: Drone_3  
- **Protocol**: Pre-flight checks, takeoff, navigation to N108, imaging of CO2 frost, data transmission, and return to launch pad.

**Note**: The procedure for CO2 Frost Mapping also includes nodes N63 and N53. However, based on the provided trajectories, Drone_1 did not reach N63, leaving this node unmapped in the current mission.
