The tool assigns nodes based on feasibility and efficiency. Rover assignments are:

- **Rover_0**: Assigned to reach N20.
- **Rover_1**: Loops through N86.
- **Rover_2**: Heads to N70.
- **Rover_3**: Follows a route similar to rover_0.
- **Rover_4**: Proceeds to N102.

Each assignment ensures optimal paths considering energy and distance.
