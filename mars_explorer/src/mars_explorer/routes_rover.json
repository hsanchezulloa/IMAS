To allocate nodes to rovers using the Multi_Rover_Node_Assigner tool, we structure the input as follows:

```json
{
  "rover_0": {
    "loc": "N30",
    "energy": 59,
    "targets": ["N12", "N20"]
  },
  "rover_1": {
    "loc": "N84",
    "energy": 76,
    "targets": ["N59", "N70", "N86", "N102"]
  },
  "rover_2": {
    "loc": "N30",
    "energy": 59,
    "targets": ["N12", "N20"]
  },
  "rover_3": {
    "loc": "N84",
    "energy": 76,
    "targets": ["N59", "N70", "N86", "N102"]
  },
  "rover_4": {
    "loc": "N30",
    "energy": 59,
    "targets": ["N12", "N20"]
  },
  "rover_5": {
    "loc": "N84",
    "energy": 76,
    "targets": ["N59", "N70", "N86", "N102"]
  }
}
```

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Extract Rover Data:** For each rover (rover_0 to rover_5), extract their location, energy level, and feasible target nodes from the provided context.

2. **Identify Feasible Targets:** Check each node in a rover's output_nodes to see if it is feasible ("feasible": true). Collect these nodes as targets for that rover.

3. **Construct Input JSON:** Create an input object where each key is a rover ID, and the value includes their location, energy, and array of feasible target nodes.

4. **Pass to Tool:** Feed this structured JSON into the Multi_Rover_Node_Assigner tool to perform the allocation based on distance and battery constraints.

This approach ensures that each rover's capabilities are accurately represented for optimal node allocation.
