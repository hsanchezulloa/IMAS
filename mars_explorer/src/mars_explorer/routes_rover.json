To fairly distribute the 35 nodes among the four rovers (rover_0, rover_1, rover_2, and rover_4), we can assign them as follows:

- **Rover_0**: N1, N2, N4, N6, N8, N9, N11, N20, N25, N30, N28, N23, N18, N13, N86 (15 nodes)
- **Rover_1**: N72, N77, N82, N84, N85, N86 (6 nodes) [Note: N86 is already assigned to Rover_0]
  
  Correction: Assign N72, N77, N82, N84, N85 to Rover_1 (5 nodes)
- **Rover_2**: N70, N82 (2 nodes) [Note: N82 is already assigned to Rover_1]
  
  Correction: Assign N70 to Rover_2 (1 node)
- **Rover_3**: N12, N22, N21, N30, N28, N23, N18, N13 (8 nodes) [Note: N30, N28, etc., are already assigned to Rover_0]
  
  Correction: Assign N12, N22, N21 to Rover_3 (3 nodes)
- **Rover_4**: All their nodes (N88, N90, N93, N94, N95, N96, N101, N102) (8 nodes)

However, this approach leads to overlapping assignments. To resolve this, we need to ensure each node is assigned to only one rover.

**Final Assignment:**

- **Rover_0**: N1, N2, N4, N6, N8, N9, N11, N20, N25 (9 nodes)
- **Rover_1**: N72, N77, N82, N84, N85, N86 (6 nodes)
- **Rover_2**: N70 (1 node)
- **Rover_3**: N12, N22, N21, N30, N28, N23, N18, N13 (8 nodes)
- **Rover_4**: N88, N90, N93, N94, N95, N96, N101, N102 (8 nodes)

This distribution ensures each node is assigned to exactly one rover, with Rover_0 having the most nodes due to its extensive path.
