Node Allocation Plan for Rovers**

1. **Rover_0 (Location: N30, Energy: 95)**
   - Assigned Nodes: N20
     - Feasibility: Distance is optimal; energy sufficient without warnings.

2. **Rover_1 (Location: N84, Energy: 94)**
   - Assigned Nodes: N70 and N86
     - Feasibility: Both nodes are feasible with adequate energy levels.

3. **Rover_2 (Location: N84, Energy: 76)**
   - Assigned Nodes: N70 and N86
     - Feasibility: Both nodes are feasible; energy sufficient for the tasks.

4. **Rover_3 (Location: N30, Energy: 59)**
   - Assigned Nodes: N20
     - Feasibility: Node is feasible with enough energy to complete the task.

5. **Rover_4 (Location: N84, Energy: 80)**
   - Assigned Nodes: N70 and N86
     - Feasibility: Both nodes are feasible; energy levels are adequate for the tasks.

This allocation ensures each rover is assigned at least one node, optimizes distance, and considers remaining energy to prioritize feasibility.
