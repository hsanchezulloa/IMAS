**Mission Priorities:**
1. Drones assigned to pollution plumes (Drone 1) and methane hotspots (Drone 5) have the highest priority due to potential environmental impact.
2. Ground-level sampling in industrial zones (Drone 2) is critical for urban air quality assessment.
3. High-altitude CO₂ tracking (Drone 3) is essential for understanding atmospheric dynamics.
4. Agricultural monitoring (Drone 4) supports crop health and sustainability efforts.

**Safety Precautions:**
- Ensure all drones maintain safe distances from obstacles and each other.
- Monitor weather conditions; abort missions if wind speeds exceed 20 knots or visibility drops below 1 km.
- Return to Launch (RTL) immediately if communication loss is detected.

**Efficiency Measures:**
- Optimize flight paths using grid patterns for maximum coverage.
- Use waypoints that minimize overlap and ensure efficient data collection.
