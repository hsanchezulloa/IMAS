**Drone-Based Sampling Operations Plan**

1. **Drone 1: Urban Atmospheric Sampling**
   - **Objective**: Collect air samples in urban areas with high pollution levels.
   - **Route**: Major city centers, industrial zones, traffic-heavy intersections.
   - **Altitude**: 100-150 meters.
   - **Sampling Frequency**: Every 5 minutes for 30 minutes per location.
   - **Safety Measures**: Avoid peak traffic hours and adverse weather.

2. **Drone 2: Forest CO₂ Measurements**
   - **Objective**: Measure CO₂ levels in forested areas.
   - **Route**: Dense forest regions, canopy and understory layers.
   - **Altitude**: 50-100 meters.
   - **Sampling Frequency**: Every 10 minutes for 20 minutes per location.
   - **Safety Measures**: Use obstacle detection systems.

3. **Drone 3: Coastal CO₂ and Atmospheric Sampling**
   - **Objective**: Monitor CO₂ levels and atmospheric conditions along the coastline.
   - **Route**: Shoreline, industrial ports, natural reserves.
   - **Altitude**: 80-120 meters.
   - **Sampling Frequency**: Every 7 minutes for 25 minutes per location.
   - **Safety Measures**: Avoid high tide or strong winds.

4. **Drone 4: Open Field CO₂ Measurements**
   - **Objective**: Assess CO₂ levels in agricultural and open field areas.
   - **Route**: Crop fields, pastures with minimal obstacles.
   - **Altitude**: 120 meters.
   - **Sampling Frequency**: Every 15 minutes for 30 minutes per location.
   - **Safety Measures**: Clear communication with ground teams.
