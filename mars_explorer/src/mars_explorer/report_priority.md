To effectively evaluate and prioritize mission objectives, I will consider scientific value, operational urgency, and alignment with overall mission goals. Each task will be assessed based on these criteria to determine its priority level: high, medium, or low.

### Mission Tasks Evaluation

1. **Seismic Sensor Deployment**
   - **Scientific Value**: High. Seismic sensors provide critical data for understanding geological activity and potential hazards.
   - **Operational Urgency**: High. Timely deployment is crucial for capturing relevant seismic events.
   - **Mission Goals Alignment**: Directly supports core mission objectives related to geophysical research.

   **Priority Assignment**: High
   - **Rationale**: The deployment of seismic sensors is essential for the success of the mission due to its high scientific value and urgency. It directly aligns with key mission goals, making it a top priority.

2. **Imaging Tasks**
   - **Scientific Value**: Medium. Imaging provides valuable visual data but may not be as critical as direct sensor measurements.
   - **Operational Urgency**: Low to Medium. While important, imaging can often be scheduled flexibly without immediate impact on mission success.
   - **Mission Goals Alignment**: Supports secondary objectives related to mapping and visual analysis.

   **Priority Assignment**: Medium
   - **Rationale**: Imaging tasks are valuable for comprehensive data collection but do not have the same urgency or direct alignment with primary mission goals as seismic sensor deployment. They can be scheduled around higher-priority activities.

3. **Sampling Tasks**
   - **Scientific Value**: High. Samples provide tangible evidence and detailed analysis opportunities.
   - **Operational Urgency**: Medium to High. Sampling may require specific conditions, making timely execution important.
   - **Mission Goals Alignment**: Directly supports primary scientific objectives related to material analysis.

   **Priority Assignment**: High
   - **Rationale**: Sampling is crucial for achieving core mission goals and provides high scientific value. While it may not always be as urgent as seismic deployment, its importance warrants a high priority status.

4. **Communication Relay**
   - **Scientific Value**: Low to Medium. Essential for data transmission but does not directly contribute to scientific outcomes.
   - **Operational Urgency**: High. Reliable communication is critical for mission control and coordination.
   - **Mission Goals Alignment**: Supports operational objectives related to maintaining contact and data flow.

   **Priority Assignment**: High
   - **Rationale**: Although communication relay has lower direct scientific value, its high operational urgency makes it a top priority. Ensuring robust communication channels is vital for the overall success and safety of the mission.

5. **Optional Imaging Tasks**
   - **Scientific Value**: Low. Provides supplementary data that may not be critical.
   - **Operational Urgency**: Low. Can be deferred without significant impact on mission outcomes.
   - **Mission Goals Alignment**: Supports tertiary objectives related to additional visual documentation.

   **Priority Assignment**: Low
   - **Rationale**: Optional imaging tasks have the lowest priority due to their minimal scientific value and lack of urgency. They can be postponed or deprioritized in favor of more critical activities.

### Final Priority Report

- **High Priority Tasks**:
  - Seismic Sensor Deployment: Essential for capturing seismic data, directly aligns with mission goals.
  - Sampling Tasks: Provides high-value samples crucial for scientific analysis and mission objectives.
  - Communication Relay: Ensures operational success through reliable communication channels.

- **Medium Priority Task**:
  - Imaging Tasks: Valuable for comprehensive data collection but less urgent than high-priority tasks.

- **Low Priority Task**:
  - Optional Imaging Tasks: Supplementary in nature, can be deferred without impacting mission success.

This priority report ensures that critical tasks receive the necessary resources and attention to optimize mission success.
