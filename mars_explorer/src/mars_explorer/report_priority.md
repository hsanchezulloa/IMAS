### Priority Report for Mission Objectives and Tasks

#### High-Priority Tasks

1. **Seismic Sensor Deployment**
   - **Rationale**: Essential for understanding geological activity and potential hazards, providing critical data on planetary geology with high scientific value and operational urgency.

2. **Communication Relay Setup**
   - **Rationale**: Vital for coordinating mission activities and ensuring safety, enabling real-time data transmission and decision-making with medium scientific value but high operational urgency.

#### Medium-Priority Tasks

1. **Imaging of Key Geological Features**
   - **Rationale**: Provides visual context to aid in target selection for further study, supporting subsequent sampling activities with high scientific value and medium operational urgency.

2. **Initial Sampling of Surface Materials**
   - **Rationale**: Fundamental for understanding site composition and history, offering direct contributions to scientific objectives with high scientific value and medium operational urgency.

#### Low-Priority Tasks

1. **Extended Imaging Campaigns**
   - **Rationale**: Valuable but can be delayed until critical infrastructure is in place, providing additional context with medium scientific value and low operational urgency.

2. **Secondary Sampling Operations**
   - **Rationale**: Can be postponed until primary sampling results are analyzed, allowing for informed decisions on further collection efforts with medium to low scientific value and low operational urgency.

This prioritization ensures that critical infrastructure and data collection are established first, supporting the mission's scientific goals while maintaining operational safety and efficiency.
