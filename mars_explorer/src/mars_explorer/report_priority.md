To effectively evaluate the mission objectives and tasks provided by the planner agent, I will consider several key factors: scientific value, operational urgency, and alignment with overall mission goals. These criteria will help in distinguishing between high-, medium-, and low-priority activities.

### High-Priority Tasks

1. **Critical Sensor Deployment**
   - **Rationale**: The deployment of seismic sensors is crucial for gathering essential data that directly impacts the mission's primary scientific objectives. This task has a high operational urgency because it lays the foundation for subsequent analyses and decision-making processes.
   
2. **Communication Relay Setup**
   - **Rationale**: Establishing reliable communication channels is vital to ensure continuous data flow between the mission site and command centers. Any delay in this setup could jeopardize real-time monitoring and response capabilities, making it a high-priority task.

3. **Emergency Response Preparedness**
   - **Rationale**: Given the unpredictable nature of missions, having an emergency response plan ready is essential for mitigating risks and ensuring team safety. This task has both operational urgency and significant mission impact, warranting its high priority status.

### Medium-Priority Tasks

1. **Imaging Operations**
   - **Rationale**: While imaging provides valuable data that can enhance scientific understanding, it may not be immediately critical to the core objectives of the mission. Therefore, it is assigned a medium priority, allowing for flexibility in scheduling based on resource availability.
   
2. **Routine Sampling Activities**
   - **Rationale**: Routine sampling contributes to long-term scientific goals but does not require immediate attention compared to sensor deployment or communication setup. Thus, it falls into the medium-priority category.

3. **Data Analysis and Reporting**
   - **Rationale**: Although crucial for interpreting mission results, data analysis can be conducted in parallel with other ongoing tasks. Its priority is medium because it depends on the completion of high-priority tasks like sensor deployment and communication setup.

### Low-Priority Tasks

1. **Optional Imaging Tasks**
   - **Rationale**: These tasks are supplementary to primary imaging operations and do not significantly impact immediate mission goals. As such, they can be deferred without compromising overall mission success.
   
2. **Non-Essential Equipment Maintenance**
   - **Rationale**: While maintenance is important for long-term equipment functionality, non-essential maintenance tasks can be postponed until critical objectives are met.

3. **Secondary Data Collection**
   - **Rationale**: Collecting additional data that does not directly contribute to the primary mission goals or scientific questions can be considered low priority. This allows resources to focus on more impactful activities first.

### Final Answer

**Priority Report:**

- **High-Priority Tasks:**
  1. Critical Sensor Deployment
     - Essential for foundational data collection and immediate impact on mission objectives.
  2. Communication Relay Setup
     - Vital for maintaining real-time communication and operational efficiency.
  3. Emergency Response Preparedness
     - Crucial for risk mitigation and ensuring team safety.

- **Medium-Priority Tasks:**
  1. Imaging Operations
     - Important for scientific data but not immediately critical.
  2. Routine Sampling Activities
     - Contributes to long-term goals without immediate urgency.
  3. Data Analysis and Reporting
     - Necessary for interpreting results, dependent on high-priority task completion.

- **Low-Priority Tasks:**
  1. Optional Imaging Tasks
     - Supplementary and non-critical to primary objectives.
  2. Non-Essential Equipment Maintenance
     - Can be deferred without immediate impact.
  3. Secondary Data Collection
     - Does not directly contribute to core mission goals.

This priority report ensures that critical tasks receive the necessary resources and attention, optimizing mission success by focusing on high-impact activities first.
