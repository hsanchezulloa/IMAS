The mission objectives and tasks were not explicitly provided by the planner agent in the user input. As the Priority Agent, I require specific mission tasks—including their scientific value, operational urgency, and alignment with mission goals—to evaluate and assign relative priorities. Without this critical input, I cannot generate a priority report that distinguishes between high-, medium-, and low-priority activities. To proceed, the planner agent must supply the complete list of mission tasks (e.g., seismic sensor deployment, imaging operations, sampling activities, communication relay functions) along with their associated metrics. Until then, this evaluation remains impossible. Please provide the mission task details for a precise, actionable priority assessment.
