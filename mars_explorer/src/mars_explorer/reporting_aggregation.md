  "rovers": "- **High Priority Tasks**: \n  - Seismic Sensor Deployment: Essential for capturing seismic data. Ensure operations avoid dangerous zones with geological instability.\n  - Sampling Tasks: Crucial for scientific analysis; prioritize stable terrain and monitor radiation exposure levels.\n- **Operational Constraints**: \n  - Avoid areas with high radiation or unstable terrain.\n  - Monitor real-time weather updates to prevent operations during dust storms or extreme temperatures.\n  - Ensure all equipment is rated for current temperature ranges.",
  
  "drones": "- **High Priority Tasks**: \n  - Seismic Sensor Deployment: Support deployment in stable conditions, avoiding high wind gusts and dust storm areas.\n- **Operational Constraints**: \n  - Limit flights during high winds (above 25 mph) or active dust storms to ensure stability and visibility.\n  - Schedule operations during cooler parts of the day to prevent overheating.\n  - Continuously monitor weather updates for sudden changes.",
  
  "satellites": "- **High Priority Tasks**: \n  - Imaging Tasks: Conduct imaging in areas with good visibility, avoiding regions affected by dust storms.\n- **Operational Constraints**: \n  - Ensure data transmission is prioritized during stable atmospheric conditions to maintain communication relay effectiveness.\n  - Monitor weather patterns for any changes that could impact satellite operations or data quality."
