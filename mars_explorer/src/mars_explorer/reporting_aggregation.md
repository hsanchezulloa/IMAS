  "rovers": "- **High-Priority Tasks:**\n  - Critical Sensor Deployment: Essential for foundational data collection.\n  - Communication Relay Setup: Vital for maintaining real-time communication.\n  - Emergency Response Preparedness: Crucial for risk mitigation and safety.\n\n- **Hazards to Avoid:**\n  - Unstable terrain, high-radiation areas, extreme temperatures.\n\n- **Weather Considerations:**\n  - Moderate winds (15-20 mph) with gusts up to 30 mph in open areas. Use stabilizing platforms.\n  - Dust storm developing over the eastern sector; avoid this area due to reduced visibility and sensor effectiveness.\n  - High temperatures (35°C during day, 20°C at night); use thermal management systems.\n\n- **Operational Recommendations:**\n  - Avoid eastern sector due to dust storm. Monitor central areas as storm moves westward.\n  - Schedule operations during cooler periods of the day to mitigate temperature effects.",
  
  "drones": "- **High-Priority Tasks:**\n  - Critical Sensor Deployment: Support with aerial data collection where feasible.\n  - Communication Relay Setup: Ensure drones are equipped for relay tasks if needed.\n\n- **Hazards to Avoid:**\n  - High winds and gusts (up to 40 mph forecasted), especially in open areas.\n  - Dust storm affecting visibility and sensor effectiveness; avoid eastern sector and monitor central area.\n  - Extreme temperatures impacting battery life and electronics; ensure adequate cooling systems are used.\n\n- **Weather Considerations:**\n  - Moderate winds with potential gusts up to 40 mph. Limit flights in exposed regions during peak wind periods.\n  - Dust storm reducing visibility below 500 meters in eastern sector, moving westward.\n  - High temperatures (35°C daytime) affecting performance; schedule flights during cooler times.\n\n- **Operational Recommendations:**\n  - Avoid operations in dust-affected zones and high-wind areas. Schedule flights early morning or late evening for optimal conditions.",
  
  "satellites": "- **High-Priority Tasks:**\n  - Critical Sensor Deployment: Provide support through remote sensing data.\n  - Communication Relay Setup: Ensure satellite communication channels are operational.\n\n- **Hazards to Avoid:**\n  - Monitor high-radiation areas and extreme temperatures for potential impacts on satellite operations.\n\n- **Weather Considerations:**\n  - Moderate winds and dust storm affecting ground operations; ensure data collection accounts for these conditions.\n  - High temperatures may affect ground-based equipment but not directly impacting satellites.\n\n- **Operational Recommendations:**\n  - Focus on remote sensing to monitor weather changes, especially the movement of the dust storm. Provide real-time updates to support ground crew decisions."
