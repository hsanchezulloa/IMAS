To create a unified mission context tailored specifically for each crew (rovers, drones, satellites), I will synthesize information from the priority, hazard, and weather reports. The goal is to ensure that each crew receives only relevant data aligned with their capabilities and responsibilities.

### Thought Process

1. **Rovers:**
   - Focus on tasks involving ground operations such as sensor deployment and sampling.
   - Highlight hazards related to terrain instability, radiation zones, temperature extremes, and dust storms.
   - Consider weather impacts like wind intensity and temperature fluctuations affecting rover mobility and equipment functionality.

2. **Drones:**
   - Emphasize imaging and data relay tasks that drones can perform efficiently.
   - Address hazards such as high winds, dust storms, and visibility issues impacting drone stability and sensor accuracy.
   - Include weather considerations like wind speeds and temperature extremes affecting battery life and flight performance.

3. **Satellites:**
   - Concentrate on communication relay setup and broad-area imaging tasks.
   - Discuss operational constraints related to radiation exposure limits and the need for continuous monitoring of environmental conditions from orbit.
   - Consider weather impacts primarily in terms of data transmission reliability and visibility for imaging purposes.
