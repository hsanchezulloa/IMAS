additional_information:
  description: >
    Your ONLY job is to take the entire raw text provided in 'mission_report' 
    and pass it UNCHANGED to the 'planner_divide_report' tool in the 'markdown_report' argument.
    
    Do NOT try to extract nodes or terrains yourself. 
    Do NOT summarize. 
    Pass the raw markdown exactly as it is: """ {{mission_report}} """
  expected_output: >
    The raw dictionary output from the planner_divide_report tool.
  agent: planner

reporting_priority:
  description: >
    Evaluate the mission objectives and tasks provided by the planner agent.
    Determine the relative priority of each task based on scientific value,
    operational urgency, and mission goals. Clearly distinguish between
    high-, medium-, and low-priority activities.
  expected_output: >
    A priority report ranking mission tasks and explaining the rationale
    behind each priority assignment (e.g., critical sensor deployment versus
    optional imaging tasks).
  agent: priority

reporting_hazard:
  description: >
    Identify environmental hazards and operational constraints affecting the mission,
    including terrain instability, radiation exposure, extreme temperatures,
    and weather-related risks provided by the weather agent. Consolidate all
    identified hazards into a coherent risk assessment.
  expected_output: >
    A hazard report describing dangerous zones, forbidden nodes, and operational
    constraints that must be respected by all crews to ensure mission safety.
  agent: hazard

reporting_weather:
  description: >
    Analyze the weather and environmental conditions relevant to the mission area,
    including wind intensity, dust storms, temperature extremes, and visibility.
    Identify conditions that may affect mission operations, especially aerial
    activities such as drone flights. Communicate any weather-related constraints
    to the hazard agent.
  expected_output: >
    A weather report detailing current and potential environmental conditions,
    specifying which areas or operations should be avoided or limited due to
    weather risks.
  agent: weather


reporting_aggregation:
  description: >
    Combine the reports produced by the priority, hazard, and weather agents into
    a unified mission context. Filter and tailor the information so that each
    specialized crew (rovers, drones, satellites) receives only the data relevant
    to its capabilities and responsibilities.
    You MUST return ONLY valid JSON.
    Do NOT include markdown code fences.
    Do NOT include explanations or extra text.

    The JSON object MUST have EXACTLY these keys:
    - rovers
    - drones
    - satellites
    Each value MUST be a string containing a markdown-formatted briefing tailored
    to that crew (priorities, hazards, constraints).
  agent: aggregator
