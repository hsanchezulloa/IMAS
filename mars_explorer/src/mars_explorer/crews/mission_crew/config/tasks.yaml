additional_information:
  description: >
    Analyze the initial Mars mission report to extract the main objectives,
    constraints, and operational context. Identify missing or ambiguous information
    and, when necessary, gather additional relevant data (e.g., environmental conditions,
    mission constraints, or scientific requirements). Divide the mission information
    into structured subreports tailored for priority assessment, hazard analysis,
    and weather evaluation.
  expected_output: >
    A structured mission decomposition including: a subreport for task prioritization, a subreport for hazard and constraint analysis, a subreport for weather and environmental analysis and each subreport should contain only the information relevant to its target agent.
  agent: planner

reporting_priority:
  description: >
    Evaluate the mission objectives and tasks provided by the planner agent.
    Determine the relative priority of each task based on scientific value,
    operational urgency, and mission goals. Clearly distinguish between
    high-, medium-, and low-priority activities.
  expected_output: >
    A priority report ranking mission tasks and explaining the rationale
    behind each priority assignment (e.g., critical sensor deployment versus
    optional imaging tasks).
  agent: priority

reporting_hazard:
  description: >
    Identify environmental hazards and operational constraints affecting the mission,
    including terrain instability, radiation exposure, extreme temperatures,
    and weather-related risks provided by the weather agent. Consolidate all
    identified hazards into a coherent risk assessment.
  expected_output: >
    A hazard report describing dangerous zones, forbidden nodes, and operational
    constraints that must be respected by all crews to ensure mission safety.
  agent: hazard

reporting_weather:
  description: >
    Analyze the weather and environmental conditions relevant to the mission area,
    including wind intensity, dust storms, temperature extremes, and visibility.
    Identify conditions that may affect mission operations, especially aerial
    activities such as drone flights. Communicate any weather-related constraints
    to the hazard agent.
  expected_output: >
    A weather report detailing current and potential environmental conditions,
    specifying which areas or operations should be avoided or limited due to
    weather risks.
  agent: weather


reporting_aggregation:
  description: >
    Combine the reports produced by the priority, hazard, and weather agents into
    a unified mission context. Filter and tailor the information so that each
    specialized crew (rovers, drones, satellites) receives only the data relevant
    to its capabilities and responsibilities.
  expected_output: >
    An aggregated mission report containing: a rover-specific briefing, a drone-specific briefing, a satellite-specific briefing
    Each briefing should include priorities, hazards, and constraints relevant
    to the corresponding crew.
  agent: aggregator
