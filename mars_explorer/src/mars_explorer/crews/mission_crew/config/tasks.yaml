additional_information:
  description: >
    Analyze the initial Mars mission report to extract the main objectives,
    constraints, and operational context. Identify missing or ambiguous information
    and, when necessary, gather additional relevant data (e.g., environmental conditions,
    mission constraints, or scientific requirements). Divide the mission information
    into structured subreports tailored for priority assessment, hazard analysis,
    and weather evaluation. Mission report: {{mission_report}}. Additionally, enrich the mission information using relevant facts extracted from the following URLs (if necessary): {{urls}}
