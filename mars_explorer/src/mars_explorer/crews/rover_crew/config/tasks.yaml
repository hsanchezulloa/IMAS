final_nodes:
  description: >
    Based on the information inside the input file """ {{report_priority}} """, identify in which nodes rovers need to perform their tasks.
  expected_output: >
    A Python list containing all the node IDs where rovers need to perform their tasks.
  agent: extractor


reporting_route:
  description: >
    For each node in the provided list, choose 1 rover among the provided in the """ {{rovers}} """ input file.
    For each node-rover pair, you MUST use the tool RoverPathfindingTool to calculate the path. Do NOT modify the path provided by such tool.
    The routes are computed from the location of the rover (base) to the selected final node, and then back to the base. Don't modify this path, just store it!.
    For each rover provide the paths returned by the tool.
  expected_output: >
    A JSON with this format:
      {"rover_1": [[N30, N31, N32, N30], ["N30", "N2", "N5", "N9", "N4", "N30"]],
         "rover_2": [[N84, N83, N82, N81, N84]]
        }

reporting_sampling:
  description: >
    Generates a detailed report of all samples to be collected, including the type of
    sample, sensors used, collection procedure, and any relevant observations.
    Sends the report to the plan integrator agent.
  expected_output: >
    A detailed report containing the sampling instructions for each rover.
