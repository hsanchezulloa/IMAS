    CALL THE TOOL Batch_Route_Calculator NOW.

    Tool name: Batch_Route_Calculator

    Tool arguments (use EXACTLY these variable names):
    - targets_list: final nodes recieved from the extractor agent
    - rovers_data: {{rovers}}

    AFTER THE TOOL RETURNS:
    - Output EXACTLY the tool output.
    - Do NOT add text.
    - Do NOT modify JSON.

    FAILURE CONDITIONS:
    - If you output paths without calling the tool,  FAIL.
    - If you shorten or invent paths, FAIL.

  expected_output: >
    A JSON file contaioning the EXACT output of Batch_Route_Calculator
    Example:
    {"rover_1": [["N90", "N95", "N100", "N102", "N100", "N95", "N90"]],
     "rover_0": [["N30", "N40", "N55", "N70", "N55", "N40", "N30"]]}
