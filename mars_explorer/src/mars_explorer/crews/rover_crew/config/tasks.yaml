#     Using the list of rovers provided in the input """ {{rovers}} """,
#     and the list of target nodes provided in """ {{context.final_nodes}} """,
#     you MUST call the tool Multi_Rover_Route_Calculator exactly once.

#     The tool will automatically extract each rover's location and energy
#     and compute the shortest distance from each rover to every target node.

#     Do NOT recompute paths manually.
#     Do NOT modify, filter, or reinterpret the tool output.
#     Simply return the result exactly as produced by the tool.

#   expected_output: >
#     The raw dictionary output from the Multi_Rover_Route_Calculator tool. DO NOT MODIFY THE OUTPUT. Just copy it.
#     The raw, unmodified dictionary/JSON output from the Multi_Rover_Route_Calculator tool containing rover IDs, locations, energy, and path feasibility data.

    You MUST do exactly these steps:
    Step 1) Call Multi_Rover_Route_Calculator with:
      - rovers = """ {{rovers}} """
      - final_nodes = """ {{context.final_nodes}} """
    Step 2) Return EXACTLY the tool output bytes as JSON.
    Rules:
      - Do NOT add keys
      - Do NOT remove keys
      - Do NOT reformat
      - Do NOT summarize
      - Do NOT explain
      - Output must be valid JSON and nothing else.

#     ACTION REQUIRED:
#       1. Extract the JSON/Dictionary from the input.
#       2. Call 'Multi_Rover_Node_Assigner' tool using that data as the 'rover_results' parameter.

#     STRICT RESTRICTIONS:
#       DO NOT summarize the data.,
#       DO NOT explain why you are calling the tool.,
#       DO NOT attempt to assign rovers to nodes manually.,
#       If the input is empty, return an empty dictionary through the tool.

    You have been provided with rover route and energy data (found in the routes_rover input).
    
    Your SOLE task is to:
    1. Take the provided 'routes_rover' dictionary.
    2. Pass it DIRECTLY into the 'Multi_Rover_Node_Assigner' tool as the 'rover_results' argument.
    
    Do NOT attempt to process, summarize, or manually assign the rovers yourself. 
    The tool handles all calculations.
    The input routes_rover is in """ {{context.reporting_route}} """"
  expected_output: >
    The final assignments dictionary produced by the tool.
