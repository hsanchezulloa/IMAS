    You MUST do exactly these steps:
    Step 1) Call Multi_Rover_Route_Calculator with:
      - rovers = """ {{rovers}} """

    Step 2) Return EXACTLY the tool output bytes as JSON.
    Rules:
      - Do NOT add keys
      - Do NOT remove keys
      - Do NOT reformat

  description: >
    Analyze the goals in """ {{report_priority}} """ for the rovers.
    For each unique goal/terrain combination found in the file, write a detailed procedure in Markdown.
    Generates a detailed report of all samples to be collected, including the type of sample, sensors used, collection procedure, and any relevant observations.
