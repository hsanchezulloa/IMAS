orbit_planning_task:
  description: >
    Using all available mission data, compute the optimal orbital trajectories for
    satellite coverage, communication windows, and data-relay efficiency.
    Consider constraints such as line-of-sight visibility, energy usage, orbital
    mechanics, ground station accessibility, and required imaging targets.
    The orbit plan must be suitable for execution and clear enough for downstream
    agents to use in satellite-level planning.
  expected_output: >
    A detailed orbital plan including:
      - recommended orbital paths and maneuvers
      - coverage analysis for required targets
      - communication window predictions
  agent: orbit_planner

satellite_planning_task:
  description: >
    Based on the orbital plan and mission data, compute the detailed operational
    plan for each satellite. Include thermal scanning schedules, panoramic imaging
    sequences, communication operations, and any required calibrations or safety
    considerations.
  expected_output: >
    A complete satellite mission plan including:
      - task timelines for each satellite
      - imaging and scanning operations
  agent: satellite_planner
