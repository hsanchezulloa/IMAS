final_nodes:
  description: >
    Based on the information inside the input file """ {{report_priority}} """, identify in which nodes drones need to perform their tasks.
  expected_output: >
    A Python list containing all the node IDs where drones need to perform their tasks.
  agent: extractor

reporting_route:
  description: >
    For each node in the provided list, choose 1 drone among the provided in the """ {{drones}} """ input file.
    For each node-drone pair, you MUST use the tool DroneFlightCheckTool to calculate the path. Do NOT modify the path provided by such tool.
    The routes are computed from the location of the drone (base) to the selected final node, and then back to the base. Don't modify this path, just store it!.
    For each drone provide the paths returned by the tool.
  expected_output: >
    A JSON with this format:
      {"drone_1": [[N30, N31, N32, N30], ["N30", "N2", "N5", "N9", "N4", "N30"]],
         "drone_2": [[N84, N83, N82, N81, N84]]
        }

generate_sampling:
  description: >
    Plan and coordinate drone-based sampling operations based on mission objectives and environmental data. Ensure sampling plans are efficient, safe, and aligned with drone capabilities and mission priorities.
  expected_output: >
    A detailed report containing the sampling instructions for each drone.
