generating_route:
  description: >
    Analyze the aggregated mission report and the GraphML to compute optimal, safe, and energy-efficient flight routes for all drones. Consider environmental conditions, terrain elevation, airspace constraints, and mission objectives to ensure effective navigation and coverage. Compile detailed flight plans for each drone and prepare them for integration into the overall mission strategy. GraphML document: {{mars_graph}}
  expected_output: >
    A detailed report containing the optimal route for each drone

reporting_task:
  description: >
    Plan and coordinate drone-based sampling operations based on mission objectives and environmental data. Ensure sampling plans are efficient, safe, and aligned with drone capabilities and mission priorities.
  expected_output: >
    A detailed report containing the sampling instructions for each drone.
