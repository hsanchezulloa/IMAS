# Mars Mission Report

## Scientific Goals

- Collect subsurface samples from **rocky** terrain near nodes **N70**, **N102**, and **N152**.
- Capture panoramic images of **crater** terrain at nodes **N5**, **N73**, **N121** and **N150**.
- Measure radiation levels in **sandy** terrain at node **N12**, **N86** and **N1**
- Deploy seismic sensors at the **rocky** node **N20**.
- Detect organic molecules in **icy** terrain between nand **N59**.
- Air **dust** sample collection during flight over **N33** crater. 
- Map CO2 frost coverage in **icy** areas **N53**, **N63** and **N108**.
- Identification of **thermal** anomalies at **icy** nodes **N56** and **N112**.

## Operational Constraints

- **Rovers** must recharge if energy drops below 30%.
- **Rovers** must enter a heat shelter during 20min if the surface temperature is below -60ºC.
- **Rovers** cannot operate if node temperature is below -80ºC.
- **Rover's** speed is reduced by 10% in rocky, 30% in sandy, 50% in icy and 40% in crater terrains. 
- **Rover's** energy consumption is different depending on the type of terrain: 5% in rocky, increased 10% in sandy, increased 20% in icy and increased 15% in crater terrains.
- **Drones** must return to base after 25 minutes of flight.
- **Drones** are disabled if there is a storm.
- **Drones** cannot operate if wind gusts are higher than 40 km/h.
- **Drone's** energy consumption is increased 15% if wind is higher than 30 km/h.
- **Satellites** must maintain communication with the base station at N30 or N84 every 5 hours.
- **No agent** may operate in terrain classified as unstable or radioactive.
