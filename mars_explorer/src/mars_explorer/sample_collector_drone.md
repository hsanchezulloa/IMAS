# Drone Sampling Operational Procedure

## 10-Step Procedure for Drone Sampling Tasks

### Step 1: Pre-Flight System Check
- Conduct a thorough inspection of the drone's systems, including propellers, battery levels, communication links, and payload readiness.

### Step 2: Launch Drone from Base Station
- Initiate launch sequence from designated base station to ensure optimal altitude and stability for sample collection.

### Step 3: Navigate to N33 Crater for Dust Sample Collection
- Fly drone to coordinates of N33 crater, ensuring safe passage avoiding obstacles.

### Step 4: Airborne Dust Sample Collection Over N33 Crater
- Deploy dust sampling equipment during flight, capturing samples in designated collection pods.

### Step 5: Transition to Mapping CO2 Frost Coverage
- After completing dust collection, adjust drone's altitude and sensors for mapping CO2 frost.

### Step 6: Map CO2 Frost at N53, N63, and N108
- Use imaging sensors to capture data on CO2 frost distribution across specified nodes.

### Step 7: Real-Time Data Analysis
- Monitor collected data for anomalies or patterns indicative of environmental changes.

### Step 8: Return Drone to Base Station
- Execute return flight plan, ensuring safe landing and maintaining data integrity.

### Step 9: Download and Review Collected Data
- Transfer data from drone's storage to base station for analysis and verification.

### Step 10: Prepare Comprehensive Report
- Compile findings into a detailed report, including sample types, procedures, and observations.

This procedure ensures both dust collection and CO2 frost mapping are efficiently executed within a single mission framework.
