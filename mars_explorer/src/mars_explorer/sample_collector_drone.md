# Sample Collector Drone Operations Manual

## Procedure for Air Dust Sample Collection during Flight over N33 Crater

1. **Pre-Flight Check**: Conduct a thorough pre-flight inspection of the drone, including battery levels, propeller integrity, and communication systems.

2. **Takeoff**: Launch the drone from the designated launch pad at the nearest safe zone to N33 crater.

3. **Navigate to N33 Crater**: Use GPS coordinates to fly the drone directly to the N33 crater area, maintaining a safe altitude above terrain features.

4. **Initiate Sampling Mode**: Activate the air sampling system once the drone is over the crater to begin capturing dust particles.

5. **Collect Samples at High Altitude (100m)**: Hover and collect samples for 5 minutes to gather data on higher atmospheric dust concentrations.

6. **Descend to Mid-Altitude (50m)**: Lower the drone to 50 meters to capture mid-altitude dust samples, ensuring continuous collection.

7. **Maintain Safe Distance from Obstacles**: Avoid any rocks or debris near the crater to prevent damage to the drone or sample contamination.

8. **Return to Launch Point**: After completing sampling, fly back to the launch pad, ensuring no data loss during transmission.

9. **Post-Flight Check**: Inspect the drone for any damage and secure it in preparation for data analysis.

10. **Document Samples Collected**: Record all collected samples with timestamps, altitudes, and locations for future reference.

## Procedure for Mapping CO2 Frost Coverage in Icy Areas at N53, N63, and N108

1. **Pre-Flight Setup**: Ensure the drone is equipped with multispectral imaging systems and sufficient battery life for extended missions.

2. **Takeoff**: Launch from a safe zone near each target node to begin the mission.

3. **Activate Imaging Systems**: Turn on CO2 frost detection sensors and cameras before reaching the target area.

4. **Reach N53 Node**: Fly to N53, maintain a 50-meter altitude, and use imaging systems to map CO2 frost coverage.

5. **Proceed to N63 Node**: From N53, navigate to N63, repeat imaging procedures for accurate data collection.

6. **Move to N108 Node**: Continue the mission by flying to N108, ensuring consistent altitude and sensor use.

7. **Avoid Icy Terrain Hazards**: Steer clear of any unstable ice formations to prevent accidents.

8. **Monitor Battery Levels**: Check battery status periodically; return to base if levels are low.

9. **Return to Base**: After completing all nodes, fly back to the launch point for data transfer and analysis.

10. **Document Findings**: Compile images and data into a report, noting any anomalies or significant frost patterns observed.
