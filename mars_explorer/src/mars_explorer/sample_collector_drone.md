# Drone Sampling Procedures

## Air Dust Sample Collection over N33 Crater

### Step-by-Step Procedure:

1. **Pre-Flight System Check**: Ensure all drone systems are operational, including battery levels, communication links, and sampling设备.
2. **Launch Drone**: Initiate takeoff from designated launch pad.
3. **Navigate to Target Area (N33 Crater)**: Program flight plan to reach N33 crater coordinates.
4. **Initiate Sampling Sequence**: Activate the dust sampling mechanism upon reaching the target altitude.
5. **Deploy Dust Sampler**: Release or activate the dust collection device as per drone specifications.
6. **Collect Samples During Flight**: Monitor and ensure continuous sample collection over the designated area.
7. **Monitor Collection Process**: Use on-board sensors to track sample collection efficiency and adjust flight path if necessary.
8. **Return to Launch Point**: Once sampling is complete, navigate back to the starting location.
9. **Land Safely and Secure Sample**: Perform a controlled landing and secure the collected dust samples for transportation.
10. **Post-Flight Data Review**: Analyze collected data to ensure sample integrity and mission success.

## Map CO2 Frost Coverage in Icy Areas (N53, N63, N108)

### Step-by-Step Procedure:

1. **Pre-Flight System Check**: Verify all systems are operational for the mapping mission.
2. **Launch Drone**: Take off from designated location.
3. **Navigate to Target Nodes**: Program flight plan to visit N53, then N63, and finally N108 in sequence.
4. **Initiate Mapping Sequence**: Activate CO2 frost sensors upon arrival at each node.
5. **Use Sensors for Data Collection**: Employ on-board sensors to capture CO2 frost coverage data at each location.
6. **Record Data at Each Node**: Ensure data is logged accurately for N53, N63, and N108.
7. **Monitor Mapping Progress**: Track the progress of the mapping mission and adjust flight parameters if needed.
8. **Return to Launch Point**: After completing all nodes, head back to the starting location.
9. **Land Safely and Secure Data**: Perform a controlled landing and store collected data securely.
10. **Post-Flight Data Review**: Evaluate the mapped CO2 frost coverage for each node to ensure mission objectives are met.
