# Sample Collector Drone Operational Procedures

## Procedure for Air Dust Sample Collection over N33 Crater

### Step 1: Pre-Flight Planning and Safety Checks
- Review weather conditions (wind speed, temperature) to ensure optimal sampling.
- Conduct a pre-flight system check of the drone's navigation, communication, and payload systems.

### Step 2: Payload Preparation
- Ensure the dust collection unit is properly calibrated and loaded with clean sample containers.
- Attach the dust sampler securely to the drone.

### Step 3: Flight Path Planning
- Program the flight path over N33 crater at an altitude of 50 meters for optimal dust capture.
- Define waypoints to cover the entire crater area efficiently.

### Step 4: Takeoff and Initial Ascent
- Launch the drone from a safe distance away from obstacles.
- Ascend to the designated altitude, ensuring stable flight conditions.

### Step 5: Dust Sampling Over N33 Crater
- Fly the drone in a grid pattern over the crater to collect dust samples at regular intervals.
- Use on-board sensors to monitor dust concentration and adjust sampling rate if necessary.

### Step 6: Mid-Mission Check
- After completing half the flight, review data transmission and system status.
- Adjust flight parameters if anomalies are detected.

### Step 7: Post-Sampling Descent
- Once all samples are collected, initiate descent to a safe landing zone.
- Ensure smooth landing to prevent sample contamination.

### Step 8: Sample Container Transfer
- Securely transfer the dust collection unit from the drone to a containment area.
- Label containers with mission ID and sampling locations.

### Step 9: Post-Mission Data Analysis
- Download and analyze collected data for dust concentration patterns.
- Document any anomalies or unexpected findings.

### Step 10: Debriefing and Reporting
- Submit a detailed report of the mission, including sample collection results and any issues encountered.
- Prepare samples for transportation to the lab for further analysis.

## Procedure for Mapping CO2 Frost Coverage in Icy Areas (N53, N63, N108)

### Step 1: Pre-Flight Planning
- Review weather conditions to ensure clear imaging of frost patterns.
- Conduct a thorough system check of the drone's imaging and navigation systems.

### Step 2: Payload Setup
- Install high-resolution cameras and thermal sensors on the drone.
- Ensure all equipment is properly calibrated for accurate data capture.

### Step 3: Flight Path Programming
- Define flight paths that cover N53, N63, and N108 at a low altitude (30 meters).
- Include overlapping passes to ensure comprehensive coverage.

### Step 4: Takeoff and Ascent
- Launch the drone from a safe location near each node.
- Ascend to the programmed altitude, ensuring stable flight conditions.

### Step 5: CO2 Frost Imaging
- Capture high-resolution images of the terrain while mapping frost distribution.
- Use thermal sensors to identify temperature variations indicative of CO2 frost.

### Step 6: Mid-Mission Review
- After completing half the area, review data transmission and system status.
- Adjust flight parameters if necessary to optimize coverage.

### Step 7: Post-Imaging Descent
- Descend to a safe landing zone after completing all nodes.
- Ensure smooth landing to preserve image quality.

### Step 8: Data Transfer and Initial Analysis
- Download images and thermal data for preliminary analysis.
- Identify areas with significant CO2 frost coverage.

### Step 9: Reporting and Documentation
- Compile findings into a detailed report, including maps of CO2 frost distribution.
- Document any unusual patterns or potential issues encountered during the mission.

### Step 10: Mission Debriefing
- Submit the final report to mission control for further analysis.
- Prepare equipment for the next scheduled mission.
