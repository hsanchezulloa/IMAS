# Drone Sampling Operational Procedures

## Procedure for Air Dust Sample Collection over N33 Crater

### Step 1: Mission Planning
- Review mission parameters including target location (N33), altitude, and flight path.
- Confirm weather conditions are favorable for dust sample collection.

### Step 2: Pre-Flight System Check
- Conduct a thorough inspection of the drone's systems, including propellers, battery levels, and communication links.
- Ensure all sampling equipment is properly calibrated and secured.

### Step 3: Takeoff
- Launch the drone from designated takeoff area, ensuring stable ascent to specified altitude.

### Step 4: Dust Sample Collection
- Activate dust collection system at designated altitude over N33 crater.
- Fly in a grid pattern to ensure comprehensive sample coverage.

### Step 5: Data Logging
- Record environmental data such as wind speed, temperature, and atmospheric pressure during sampling.

### Step 6: Sample Handling
- Secure collected samples in containment units to prevent contamination.
- Monitor battery life and adjust flight path if necessary.

### Step 7: Return to Launch Site
- Execute programmed return route, ensuring safe landing at designated area.

### Step 8: Post-Mission Data Transfer
- Download raw data and samples for analysis.
- Conduct initial review of collected data for anomalies.

### Step 9: Documentation
- Prepare detailed mission report including flight logs, sample data, and any observed conditions.

### Step 10: Final Review and Debriefing
- Analyze results with team to discuss findings and plan next steps.

- Capture high-resolution images at regular intervals.

### Step 5: Environmental Data Collection
- Log temperature, humidity, and wind conditions during the mission.

### Step 6: Sample Analysis
- Collect surface samples if possible, handling with care to maintain integrity.

### Step 7: Return to Launch Site
- Navigate drone back using programmed route, monitoring battery levels.

### Step 8: Post-Mission Data Transfer
- Transfer images and data for analysis, verifying completeness of coverage.

### Step 9: Documentation
- Compile mission report including findings and any challenges encountered.

### Step 10: Final Review and Debriefing
- Discuss results with team to plan follow-up actions or further exploration.
