# Drone Sampling Operational Procedures

## Air Dust Sample Collection over N33 Crater

### Step-by-Step Procedure:

1. **Pre-Flight Check**: Conduct a thorough pre-flight inspection of the drone, including battery levels, propellers, and communication systems.

2. **Takeoff**: Launch the drone from the designated launch pad at the nearest safe location to N33 crater.

3. **Navigate to Target Area**: Fly the drone to the coordinates of N33 crater, maintaining a safe altitude to avoid obstacles.

4. **Initiate Sampling Sequence**: Deploy the air sampling device once the drone is over the target area.

5. **Collect Dust Samples**: Hover at varying altitudes (e.g., 50m, 100m) to collect dust samples from different layers of the atmosphere above N33 crater.

6. **Monitor Environmental Conditions**: Record real-time data on temperature, humidity, and wind speed during sample collection.

7. **Return to Launch Pad**: After completing the sampling, fly the drone back to the launch pad.

8. **Post-Flight Check**: Inspect the drone for any damage or issues after landing.

9. **Data Transfer**: Download the collected samples and environmental data from the drone's storage system.

10. **Documentation**: Log all data into the mission report, including sample IDs, collection times, and environmental conditions.

## Map CO2 Frost Coverage in Icy Areas (N53, N63, N108)

### Step-by-Step Procedure:

1. **Pre-Flight Check**: Perform a detailed pre-flight inspection of the drone to ensure readiness for the mission.

2. **Takeoff**: Launch the drone from the nearest safe location to the target nodes.

3. **Flight Planning**: Program the drone's flight path to cover N53, N63, and N108 in a systematic order.

4. **Activate Imaging System**: Turn on the high-resolution camera and CO2 frost detection sensors before reaching the first target node.

5. **Capture High-Resolution Images**: Hover over each node (N53, N63, N108) and capture multiple images to map the CO2 frost coverage.

6. **Analyze Frost Patterns**: Use on-board sensors to detect and record CO2 frost presence and distribution at each node.

7. **Proceed to Next Node**: After completing data collection at one node, fly to the next target location.

8. **Ensure Safe Distance**: Maintain a safe altitude and distance from icy terrain to avoid interference with the drone's systems.

9. **Return to Base**: Once all nodes are surveyed, fly back to the launch pad.

10. **Post-Mission Analysis**: Transfer data to the ground station for processing and create detailed maps of CO2 frost coverage.
