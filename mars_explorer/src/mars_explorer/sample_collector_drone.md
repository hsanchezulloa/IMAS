# Drone Sampling Operational Procedures

## Procedure 1: Air Dust Sample Collection over N33 Crater

### Step 1: Pre-Flight System Check
- Conduct a comprehensive pre-flight inspection of the drone, including battery levels, propeller function, and communication systems.

### Step 2: Takeoff from Designated Launch Pad
- Initiate takeoff using remote control or autonomous mode, ensuring stable ascent to the required altitude.

### Step 3: Navigate to N33 Crater Coordinates
- Use GPS navigation to fly the drone directly to the coordinates of N33 crater, maintaining a safe distance from obstacles.

### Step 4: Adjust Drone Altitude for Optimal Sampling
- Set the drone's altitude to 50 meters above the crater surface to ensure effective dust collection without disturbance.

### Step 5: Deploy Dust Collection Unit
- Activate the dust sampling device, ensuring it is positioned correctly to capture airborne particles.

### Step 6: Fly Over Target Area in Grid Pattern
- Program the drone to traverse a grid pattern over N33 crater, covering all specified coordinates methodically.

### Step 7: Collect Air Samples at Intervals
- Automatically collect dust samples every 10 seconds along the flight path to ensure comprehensive data capture.

### Step 8: Monitor Sampling Process via Telemetry
- Continuously monitor the drone's status and sample collection through telemetry, adjusting parameters as needed.

### Step 9: Return to Launch Pad Upon Completion
- After completing the sampling mission, direct the drone back to the launch pad for safe landing.

### Step 10: Secure Samples and Transmit Data
- Retrieve collected samples, store them securely, and transmit data to the control station for analysis.

## Procedure 2: Mapping CO2 Frost Coverage in Icy Areas (N53, N63, N108)

### Step 1: Pre-Flight System Check
- Perform a detailed pre-flight inspection of the drone's systems, including camera and sensor functionality.

### Step 2: Takeoff from Designated Location
- Launch the drone using remote control or autonomous mode, ensuring smooth ascent to operational altitude.

### Step 3: Navigate to N53 Coordinates
- Fly the drone to N53 using GPS, positioning it for optimal coverage of the target area.

### Step 4: Deploy CO2 Frost Sensors
- Activate sensors to begin data collection on CO2 frost presence and thickness in real-time.

### Step 5: Conduct Low-Pass Aerial Survey
- Perform a low-altitude pass (10 meters) over N53, capturing high-resolution imagery with the onboard camera.

### Step 6: Repeat Process for N63 and N108
- After completing N53, fly to N63 and then N108, repeating steps 4-5 at each location.

### Step 7: Monitor Environmental Conditions
- Keep track of weather conditions (wind speed, temperature) to ensure accurate data collection.

### Step 8: Transmit Data During Flight
- Send collected data in real-time to the control station for immediate analysis and decision-making.

### Step 9: Return to Base Upon Mission Completion
- Land the drone safely at the base after all target areas have been surveyed.

### Step 10: Analyze and Document Findings
- Review collected data, create detailed maps of CO2 frost coverage, and prepare a comprehensive report for further study.
