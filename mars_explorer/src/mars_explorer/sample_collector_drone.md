# Drone Sampling Operational Procedures

## 1. Air Dust Sample Collection Over N33 Crater

### Step-by-Step Procedure:

1. **Pre-Flight Check**: Ensure drone is fully charged, sensors are calibrated, and all systems are operational.
2. **Take Off**: Launch drone from designated launch pad at coordinates (N/A).
3. **Navigate to N33 Crater**: Fly drone directly to N33 crater using GPS navigation.
4. **Initiate Sampling Mode**: Activate air sampling system upon arrival at N33.
5. **Collect Dust Samples**: Hover at 100m altitude and collect dust samples for 5 minutes.
6. **Log Data**: Record environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, wind speed).
7. **Return to Launch Pad**: After collection, fly back to launch pad.
8. **Store Samples**: Securely store collected samples in airtight containers.
9. **Data Analysis**: Transfer data to base station for review.
10. **Post-Flight Check**: Inspect drone and sensors for any damage or issues.

## 2. Map CO2 Frost Coverage in Icy Areas (N53, N63, N108)

### Step-by-Step Procedure:

1. **Pre-Flight Planning**: Review mission parameters and weather conditions.
2. **Take Off**: Launch drone from designated launch pad at coordinates (N/A).
3. **Navigate to N53**: Fly drone to N53 using GPS navigation.
4. **Initiate Mapping Mode**: Activate CO2 frost sensors upon arrival.
5. **Map CO2 Frost**: Conduct low-altitude scan (10m) and record frost coverage.
6. **Log Data**: Capture high-resolution images and thermal data.
7. **Proceed to N63**: Fly drone to N63 and repeat steps 4-6.
8. **Proceed to N108**: Fly drone to N108 and repeat steps 4-6.
9. **Return to Launch Pad**: After completing all nodes, fly back to launch pad.
10. **Data Analysis**: Transfer data to base station for review.
