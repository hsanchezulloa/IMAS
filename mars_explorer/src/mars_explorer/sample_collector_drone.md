# Drone Sampling Operational Procedures

## 1. Air Dust Sample Collection Over N33 Crater

### Step-by-Step Procedure:

1. **Pre-Flight System Check**:  
   - Inspect drone for damage or malfunctions.  
   - Ensure all systems (propulsion, communication, sensors) are operational.

2. **Mission Planning**:  
   - Review flight path over N33 crater.  
   - Set waypoints for sample collection points.

3. **Launch Drone**:  
   - Power on and lift off from designated launch area.

4. **Navigate to Target Area**:  
   - Fly to N33 crater at a safe altitude, avoiding obstacles.

5. **Initiate Sample Collection**:  
   - Deploy air sampling device at specified intervals over the crater.

6. **Monitor Sampling Process**:  
   - Ensure samples are collected correctly and log data.

7. **Return to Base**:  
   - Fly back to launch area, ensuring safe landing.

8. **Post-Mission Check**:  
   - Inspect drone for post-flight issues.

9. **Data Transfer**:  
   - Download collected data for analysis.

10. **Documentation**:  
    - Record all observations and actions taken during the mission.

## 2. Map CO2 Frost Coverage in Icy Areas (N53, N63, N108)

### Step-by-Step Procedure:

1. **Pre-Flight System Check**:  
   - Inspect drone for damage or malfunctions.  
   - Ensure all systems are operational.

2. **Mission Planning**:  
   - Review flight paths over N53, N63, and N108.  
   - Set waypoints for imaging.

3. **Launch Drone**:  
   - Power on and lift off from designated area.

4. **Navigate to Target Areas**:  
   - Fly to each node at a safe altitude.

5. **Capture Images**:  
   - Take high-resolution images of CO2 frost coverage.

6. **Monitor Imaging Process**:  
   - Ensure images are clear and cover the required areas.

7. **Return to Base**:  
   - Fly back to launch area, ensuring safe landing.

8. **Post-Mission Check**:  
   - Inspect drone for post-flight issues.

9. **Data Processing**:  
   - Analyze images to identify CO2 frost patterns.

10. **Documentation**:  
    - Record findings and actions taken during the mission.
