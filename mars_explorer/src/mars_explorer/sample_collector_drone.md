# Sample Collector Drone Operations Manual

## Air Sample Collection at Node N33

### Step-by-Step Procedure:

1. **Pre-Flight System Check**: Ensure all drone systems are operational, including battery levels, communication links, and sampling设备.
2. **Launch Drone**: Initiate takeoff from designated launch area.
3. **Navigate to N33**: Fly drone directly to Node N33 using GPS or visual navigation.
4. **Conduct Visual Inspection**: Assess the area for any obstacles or environmental factors affecting sample collection.
5. **Deploy Air Sampling Device**: Release the sampling device at the specified altitude above Node N33.
6. **Collect Sample**: Ensure the device captures the required air volume as programmed.
7. **Secure Sample**: Retrieve the collected sample and store it in a sealed container for analysis.
8. **Return to Launch Point**: Fly drone back to the starting location.
9. **Post-Flight Check**: Inspect drone for any damage or issues post-flight.
10. **Documentation**: Record all data, including time, location, and conditions, into the mission log.

## CO2 Analysis at Nodes N53, N63, and N108

### Step-by-Step Procedure:

1. **Pre-Flight System Check**: Verify drone systems are operational for multiple missions.
2. **Launch Drone**: Take off from designated area.
3. **Navigate Sequentially**: Fly to Node N53, then proceed to N63, followed by N108.
4. **Conduct Visual Inspections**: At each node, check surroundings for any anomalies or obstructions.
5. **Deploy CO2 Analysis Devices**: Release analysis devices at each node as per protocol.
6. **Collect Data**: Gather CO2 readings from each device and ensure data integrity.
7. **Secure Data**: Store collected data securely on the drone's storage system.
8. **Return to Launch Point**: After completing all nodes, fly back to the starting location.
9. **Post-Flight Check**: Inspect drone for any operational issues after multiple missions.
10. **Documentation**: Compile and log all mission data, including CO2 levels and conditions at each node.
