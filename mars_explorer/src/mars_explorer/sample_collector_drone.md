# Sample Collector Drone Operational Procedure

## 10-Step Detailed Procedure for Drone Sampling Tasks

### Step 1: Define Objectives and Scope
- **Objective**: Clearly define the sampling goals, such as identifying mineral composition, geological features, or environmental conditions.
- **Scope**: Determine the area of interest, altitude ranges, and specific targets for drone deployment.

### Step 2: Select Appropriate Drones
- **Drone Type**: Choose drones based on mission requirements (e.g., imaging drones for high-resolution photos, sampling drones for material collection).
- **Payload Capacity**: Ensure drones can carry necessary equipment like cameras, spectrometers, or sample collection tools.

### Step 3: Plan Mission Route and Altitude
- **Mapping**: Use GIS software to map the target area.
- **Altitude Settings**: Program drones to fly at specified altitudes (high, medium, low) for optimal data collection.

### Step 4: Conduct Pre-Flight Inspection
- **Drone Check**: Inspect drones for any malfunctions or damage.
- **Battery Level**: Ensure sufficient battery life for the mission duration.
- **Weather Conditions**: Confirm favorable weather for safe flight operations.

### Step 5: Launch Drones
- **Deployment**: Launch drones from designated launch zones, ensuring proper orientation and alignment with the target area.

### Step 6: Collect Samples Using Imaging or Sampling Tools
- **Imaging Mode**: Use high-resolution cameras to capture detailed images of geological formations.
- **Sampling Tools**: Deploy tools like drills or samplers to collect physical samples from the surface or specific layers.

### Step 7: Monitor Mission in Real-Time
- **Telemetry Systems**: Track drone status, altitude, and location in real-time.
- **Adjustments**: Make necessary adjustments to flight paths or sampling procedures based on live data.

### Step 8: Safely Land Drones
- **Return Path**: Guide drones back to designated landing zones using predefined return routes.
- **Post-Landing Check**: Inspect drones for any damage incurred during the mission.

### Step 9: Download and Analyze Collected Data
- **Data Transfer**: Transfer images, samples, and other data from drones to analysis stations.
- **Initial Analysis**: Review data for preliminary findings, identifying key areas of interest.

### Step 10: Document Findings and Report
- **Report Preparation**: Compile findings into a detailed report, including methodology, results, and recommendations.
- **Review and Approval**: Submit the report for review by stakeholders or scientific teams.
