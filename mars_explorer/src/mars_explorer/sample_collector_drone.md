# Sample Collector Drone Operational Procedures

## Procedure 1: Air Dust Sample Collection during Flight over N33 Crater

### Step 1: Pre-Flight System Check
- Conduct a thorough pre-flight inspection of the drone's systems, including battery levels, propellers, sensors, and communication links.

### Step 2: Launch Drone
- Initiate takeoff from designated launch pad at base station. Ensure stable ascent to altitude.

### Step 3: Navigate to N33 Crater
- Use GPS navigation to fly to the coordinates of N33 crater, maintaining a safe distance from obstacles.

### Step 4: Deploy Sampling Equipment
- Activate the air sampling device to begin collecting dust particles as the drone hovers over the target area.

### Step 5: Collect Dust Samples
- Hover at specified altitude (e.g., 100 meters) for 30 minutes to gather sufficient dust samples. Monitor collection progress via telemetry.

### Step 6: Monitor Environmental Conditions
- Continuously track weather conditions, including wind speed and direction, temperature, and humidity, to ensure optimal sample integrity.

### Step 7: Ensure Safety Protocols
- Avoid flying over populated areas or other sensitive zones. Maintain a safe distance from the crater's edge to prevent accidents.

### Step 8: Log Data
- Record all collected data, including timestamps, coordinates, and environmental parameters, for later analysis.

### Step 9: Return to Launch Pad
- After sample collection is complete, navigate back to the launch pad using GPS. Perform a controlled landing.

### Step 10: Post-Flight Analysis
- Transfer collected samples to the lab for analysis. Review flight data for any anomalies or areas of interest.

## Procedure 2: Map CO2 Frost Coverage in Icy Areas (N53, N63, N108)

### Step 1: Pre-Flight Planning
- Download and upload mission parameters, including coordinates for N53, N63, and N108. Ensure the drone's mapping software is updated.

### Step 2: Launch Drone
- Initiate takeoff from base station. Ascend to an altitude suitable for thermal imaging (e.g., 50 meters).

### Step 3: Set Up Thermal Imaging Equipment
- Activate the thermal camera and CO2 sensor to begin capturing data as the drone approaches the target area.

### Step 4: Capture Thermal Images
- Fly over each node (N53, N63, N108) in sequence, pausing briefly at each location to capture high-resolution thermal images.

### Step 5: Analyze Data During Flight
- Monitor real-time data from the CO2 sensor and thermal camera. Look for patterns or anomalies indicative of frost coverage.

### Step 6: Ensure Equipment Functionality
- Periodically check that all sensors are functioning correctly. If an issue arises, adjust the flight path accordingly.

### Step 7: Maintain Safe Altitude
- Keep the drone at a consistent altitude to ensure accurate data collection and avoid collisions with terrain features.

### Step 8: Document Findings
- Note any significant thermal anomalies or areas of heavy CO2 frost coverage in the mission log for further investigation.

### Step 9: Return to Base Station
- After completing all target nodes, navigate back to base station. Perform a safe landing.

### Step 10: Post-Mission Analysis
- Transfer data from the drone's systems to the lab. Generate detailed maps of CO2 frost coverage and analyze thermal anomalies for scientific review.
