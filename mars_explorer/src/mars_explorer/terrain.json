To determine the terrain type associated with each node in the provided graph, we need to analyze the structure of the XML content. The XML describes a graph where nodes are connected by edges, and some nodes have specific attributes indicating their terrain types.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify Nodes**: 
   - Each `<node>` element represents a node in the graph.
   - Nodes are identified by an `id` attribute (e.g., `N0`, `N1`, etc.).

2. **Extract Terrain Types**:
   - Some nodes have a `terrain` attribute, which specifies their terrain type.
   - We need to extract these attributes for each node that has them.

3. **Create the JSON Dictionary**:
   - The final output should be a JSON dictionary where each key is a node ID and each value is the corresponding terrain type (if specified).

### Extracted Information

From the XML content, we can identify the following nodes with their respective terrain types:

- `N0`: Terrain type is "rocky"
- `N1`: Terrain type is "sandy"
- `N2`: Terrain type is "icy"
- `N3`: Terrain type is "grassy"
- `N4`: Terrain type is "swampy"

Nodes without a specified terrain attribute will not be included in the JSON dictionary.

### Constructing the Final Answer

Based on the extracted information, the JSON dictionary representing each node and its corresponding terrain type is as follows:

```json
{
  "N0": "rocky",
  "N1": "sandy",
  "N2": "icy",
  "N3": "grassy",
  "N4": "swampy"
}
```

This JSON dictionary accurately reflects the terrain types associated with each node as specified in the XML content. Nodes without a terrain attribute are omitted from this dictionary, adhering to the requirement of only including nodes with defined terrain types.
