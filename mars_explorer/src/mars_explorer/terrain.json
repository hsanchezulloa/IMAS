To address the task of creating a tailored mission briefing for specialized crews (rovers, drones, satellites) based on priority, hazard, and weather reports, I will synthesize relevant information from each report. This synthesis will ensure that each crew receives specific guidance aligned with their operational capabilities and constraints.

### Thought Process

1. **Identify Key Priorities:**
   - For rovers, the focus is on seismic sensor deployment and initial sampling of surface materials.
   - Drones prioritize imaging key geological features and setting up communication relays.
   - Satellites support communication relay setup and imaging tasks from orbit.

2. **Assess Hazards and Constraints:**
   - Rovers face terrain instability, radiation exposure, extreme temperatures, and weather-related risks.
   - Drones must navigate high wind speeds, dust storms, temperature extremes, and reduced visibility.
   - Satellites primarily deal with atmospheric disturbances affecting communication and imaging.

3. **Integrate Weather Insights:**
   - Consider current conditions such as wind intensity, dust storms, temperature ranges, and visibility to adjust operational plans for each crew.

### Final Answer

{
  "rovers": "# Rover-Specific Briefing\n\n## Priorities\n- **Seismic Sensor Deployment**: Essential for understanding geological activity and potential hazards.\n- **Initial Sampling of Surface Materials**: Fundamental for site composition analysis.\n\n## Hazards\n- **Terrain Instability**: Avoid loose soil or steep slopes; use ground-penetrating radar.\n- **Radiation Exposure**: Monitor radiation levels continuously; limit time in high-radiation zones.\n- **Extreme Temperatures**: Operate within equipment and human tolerance limits; use insulated suits if necessary.\n- **Weather-Related Risks**: Plan around weather forecasts; have evacuation plans ready.\n\n## Constraints\n- Avoid unstable terrains for heavy machinery.\n- Continuous radiation monitoring required.\n- Implement cooling measures during extreme heat.",
  "drones": "# Drone-Specific Briefing\n\n## Priorities\n- **Imaging of Key Geological Features**: Provide visual context for target selection.\n- **Communication Relay Setup**: Ensure real-time data transmission and coordination.\n\n## Hazards\n- **Wind Intensity**: High winds may affect stability; limit operations if sustained winds exceed 25 mph.\n- **Dust Storms**: Severe impact on sensor functionality; avoid aerial activities in affected regions.\n- **Extreme Temperatures**: Affect battery performance; schedule flights during cooler parts of the day.\n- **Visibility**: Reduced visibility can compromise navigation systems.\n\n## Constraints\n- Limit operations during peak heat hours (11 AM to 3 PM).\n- Avoid high wind gust areas and dust storm regions.\n- Increase reliance on GPS for navigation in low visibility.",
  "satellites": "# Satellite-Specific Briefing\n\n## Priorities\n- **Communication Relay Setup**: Support real-time data transmission and mission coordination.\n- **Imaging Tasks**: Provide visual context for ground operations.\n\n## Hazards\n- **Radiation Exposure**: Less relevant due to altitude but monitor atmospheric disturbances.\n- **Weather-Related Risks**: Potential impact on ground operations; ensure continuous data flow.\n\n## Constraints\n- Ensure robust communication links despite potential atmospheric interference."
