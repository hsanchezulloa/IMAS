To create a unified mission context tailored specifically for each crew (rovers, drones, satellites), I will synthesize information from the priority, hazard, and weather reports. The goal is to ensure that each crew receives only relevant data aligned with their capabilities and responsibilities.

### Thought Process

1. **Rovers:**
   - Focus on tasks involving ground operations such as sensor deployment and sampling.
   - Highlight hazards related to terrain instability, radiation zones, temperature extremes, and dust storms.
   - Consider weather impacts like wind intensity and temperature fluctuations affecting rover mobility and equipment functionality.

2. **Drones:**
   - Emphasize imaging and data relay tasks that drones can perform efficiently.
   - Address hazards such as high winds, dust storms, and visibility issues impacting drone stability and sensor accuracy.
   - Include weather considerations like wind speeds and temperature extremes affecting battery life and flight performance.

3. **Satellites:**
   - Concentrate on communication relay setup and broad-area imaging tasks.
   - Discuss operational constraints related to radiation exposure limits and the need for continuous monitoring of environmental conditions from orbit.
   - Consider weather impacts primarily in terms of data transmission reliability and visibility for imaging purposes.

### Final Answer

```json
{
  "rovers": "- **High-Priority Tasks:** \n  - Critical Sensor Deployment: Essential for real-time data acquisition. Immediate action required.\n  - Communication Relay Setup: Vital for operational coordination and safety.\n- **Hazards to Consider:**\n  - Terrain instability, elevated radiation levels, extreme temperatures, dust storms.\n- **Weather Impacts:**\n  - High winds may affect mobility; temperature extremes can impact equipment functionality. Ensure cooling measures are in place.",
  
  "drones": "- **High-Priority Tasks:** \n  - Imaging: Provides valuable visual data for mission analysis.\n  - Data Relay Support: Assists in maintaining communication links.\n- **Hazards to Consider:**\n  - High winds and dust storms can affect stability and sensor functionality. Limit operations during peak storm activity.\n- **Weather Impacts:**\n  - Wind speeds above 25 mph pose risks; temperature extremes impact battery life. Schedule flights during cooler parts of the day.",
  
  "satellites": "- **High-Priority Tasks:** \n  - Communication Relay Setup: Ensures continuous data transmission and operational integrity.\n  - Broad-Area Imaging: Supports mission analysis from orbit.\n- **Hazards to Consider:**\n  - Radiation exposure limits; ensure monitoring systems are calibrated for environmental conditions.\n- **Weather Impacts:**\n  - Visibility issues during dust storms may affect imaging quality. Maintain data transmission reliability."

### Terrain Type Analysis

To determine the terrain type associated with each node in the provided graph, we need to analyze the edges and their weights. The weights suggest a progression or hierarchy of terrain types based on increasing values. Here's how I interpret it:

- **Lowest Weight (160):** Likely represents the most basic or common terrain type.
- **Increasing Weights:** Indicate more specialized or challenging terrains.

Given this, we can assign terrain types to nodes as follows:

1. **N18 - N150 (Weight 160):** Basic Terrain
2. **N47 - N151 (Weight 175):** Slightly Challenging Terrain
3. **N83 - N152 (Weight 190):** Moderately Challenging Terrain
4. **N116 - N153 (Weight 210):** Highly Challenging Terrain
5. **N139 - N154 (Weight 230):** Most Challenging Terrain
