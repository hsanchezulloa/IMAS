# Drone Sampling Procedures

## Procedure 1: Air Dust Sample Collection during Flight over N33 Crater

### Step 1: Pre-Flight System Check
- Conduct a thorough pre-flight inspection of the drone, including battery levels, propeller function, and communication systems.

### Step 2: Take Off from Designated Launch Pad
- Initiate takeoff using remote control or autonomous mode, ensuring stable ascent.

### Step 3: Navigate to N33 Crater Area
- Use GPS navigation to fly towards the coordinates of N33 crater at a safe altitude.

### Step 4: Hover at 500m Altitude Above Crater
- Maintain hover position at 500 meters above the crater's surface to begin dust sampling.

### Step 5: Deploy Dust Sampling Equipment
- Activate the dust collector mechanism, ensuring it is functioning properly.

### Step 6: Collect Air Samples at Various Altitudes
- Collect samples at altitudes of 100m, 300m, and 500m to capture different layers of dust.

### Step 7: Ensure Safe Distance from Obstacles
- Monitor surroundings for any obstacles or debris that could interfere with the drone's operation.

### Step 8: Transmit Sample Data to Base Station
- Send collected data back to the base station for analysis and storage.

### Step 9: Return to Launch Pad Safely
- Navigate back to the launch pad, ensuring a smooth landing.

### Step 10: Post-Flight Inspection and Reporting
- Perform post-flight checks, recharge batteries, and document all activities in the mission log.

## Procedure 2: Map CO2 Frost Coverage in Icy Areas (N53, N63, N108)

### Step 1: Pre-Flight System Check
- Conduct a detailed pre-flight inspection of the drone's systems, including camera and sensor functionality.

### Step 2: Take Off from Designated Launch Pad
- Initiate takeoff using remote control or autonomous mode, ensuring stable ascent.

### Step 3: Navigate to N53 Node
- Fly towards the coordinates of N53 node at a safe altitude.

### Step 4: Capture High-Resolution Images of CO2 Frost
- Use imaging sensors to capture detailed images of CO2 frost coverage on the surface.

### Step 5: Proceed to N63 Node
- Navigate from N53 to N63, maintaining a safe distance and altitude.

### Step 6: Repeat Imaging at N63
- Capture additional high-resolution images at N63 node for comprehensive data collection.

### Step 7: Move to N108 Node
- Fly towards N108, ensuring smooth transition between nodes.

### Step 8: Conduct Imaging at N108
- Take more images at N108 to complete the mapping of CO2 frost coverage.

### Step 9: Transmit Data to Base Station
- Send all collected images and data back to the base station for analysis.

### Step 10: Return to Launch Pad Safely
- Navigate back to the launch pad, ensuring a smooth landing and post-flight inspection.
