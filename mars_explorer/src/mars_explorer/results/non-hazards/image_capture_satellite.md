&\text{Protocol 1: Panoramic Image Capture for Crater Terrain} \\
&\text{Step 1: Sensor Initialization - Power on the satellite's camera and ensure all systems are operational.} \\
&\text{Step 2: Positioning - Manually or automatically position the satellite over nodes N5, N58, N121, and N150, checking for communication signals.} \\
&\text{Step 3: Capture Sequence - Acquire high-resolution images in the order of N5, N58, N121, then N150, ensuring each node is fully captured.} \\
&\text{Step 4: Data Validation - Review images for clarity and completeness, verifying all nodes have been imaged correctly.} \\
&\text{Step 5: Transmission - Transmit data to ground control, prioritizing if communication loss occurs at N150.} \\

&\text{Protocol 2: Thermal Anomaly Detection for Icy Terrain} \\
&\text{Step 1: Sensor Initialization - Activate the thermal imaging sensor and ensure calibration is complete.} \\
&\text{Step 2: Positioning - Manually or automatically position over nodes N56 and N112, checking communication signals.} \\
&\text{Step 3: Capture Sequence - Use thermal sensors to scan each node for anomalies, focusing on detecting temperature irregularities.} \\
&\text{Step 4: Data Validation - Analyze data for thermal spikes or patterns indicative of anomalies.} \\
&\text{Step 5: Transmission - Transmit findings to ground control, ensuring priority is given despite potential communication loss at N150.}
