# Sample Collector Drone Operational Procedures

## 1. Air Dust Sample Collection during Flight over N33 Crater

### Step-by-Step Procedure:

1. **Pre-Flight Check**: Conduct a thorough pre-flight inspection of the drone, including battery levels, propeller integrity, and communication systems.
2. **Take Off**: Launch the drone from the designated launch pad at the base station.
3. **Navigate to N33 Crater**: Fly the drone to the coordinates of N33 Crater using GPS guidance.
4. **Adjust Altitude**: Set the drone's altitude to 50 meters above ground level for optimal dust collection.
5. **Activate Dust Sampling System**: Turn on the air sampling device to begin collecting dust particles.
6. **Collect Samples at Different Altitudes**: Ascend and descend in a grid pattern over the crater, collecting samples at 30, 50, and 70 meters.
7. **Monitor Surroundings**: Use obstacle-avoidance sensors to navigate around any rocks or uneven terrain.
8. **Log Data**: Record environmental conditions such as wind speed, temperature, and humidity during sampling.
9. **Return to Launch Pad**: After completing the sample collection, fly back to the base station.
10. **Post-Flight Check**: Inspect the drone for any damage and store collected samples securely.

### Observations:
- Ensure no obstacles are present in the flight path.
- Monitor weather conditions before takeoff.

## 2. Map CO2 Frost Coverage in Icy Areas (N53, N63, N108)

### Step-by-Step Procedure:

1. **Pre-Flight Check**: Inspect the drone for readiness, including camera and imaging system functionality.
2. **Take Off**: Launch the drone from the base station.
3. **Fly to N53 Node**: Navigate to node N53 using GPS coordinates.
4. **Initiate Imaging System**: Activate the multispectral camera to capture CO2 frost coverage.
5. **Map Icy Areas**: Fly in a grid pattern over nodes N53, N63, and N108, capturing high-resolution images.
6. **Collect Surface Samples**: If possible, use an extendable arm to gather small ice samples for analysis.
7. **Avoid Sunlight Exposure**: Adjust flight timing to avoid direct sunlight, which can melt frost.
8. **Log Environmental Data**: Record temperature, humidity, and wind speed during imaging.
9. **Return to Base Station**: After completing the mapping, fly back to the launch pad.
10. **Post-Flight Analysis**: Transfer images and samples for processing and analysis.

### Observations:
- Ensure all nodes are within the flight range.
- Avoid flying too close to the ground to prevent icing on drone components.
