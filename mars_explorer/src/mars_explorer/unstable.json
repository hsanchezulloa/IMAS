To address the tasks at hand, we need to break down each component systematically. Let's tackle them one by one:

### Task 1: Identifying Nodes with High Radiation Levels

**Objective:** Determine which nodes in a graph have edges with weights greater than 5, indicating high radiation levels.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Nodes: \( N = \{N_0, N_1, N_2, N_3, N_4\} \)
   - Edges with weights:
     - \( E_0 = (N_0, N_1) \), weight 3
     - \( E_1 = (N_1, N_2) \), weight 7
     - \( E_2 = (N_2, N_3) \), weight 5
     - \( E_3 = (N_3, N_4) \), weight 8
     - \( E_4 = (N_4, N_0) \), weight 6

2. **Identify High Radiation Edges:**
   - An edge is considered to have high radiation if its weight is greater than 5.
   - High radiation edges:
     - \( E_1 = (N_1, N_2) \), weight 7
     - \( E_3 = (N_3, N_4) \), weight 8
     - \( E_4 = (N_4, N_0) \), weight 6

3. **Determine Nodes with High Radiation:**
   - Node \( N_1 \) is the starting node of edge \( E_1 \).
   - Node \( N_3 \) is the starting node of edge \( E_3 \).
   - Node \( N_4 \) is the starting node of edge \( E_4 \).

**Conclusion:**
- Nodes with high radiation levels are \( N_1, N_3, \) and \( N_4 \).

### Final Answer for Task 1:

```json
{
  "nodes_with_high_radiation": ["N_1", "N_3", "N_4"]
}

### Task 2: Creating a Tailored Mission Briefing

**Objective:** Develop specific mission briefings for rovers, drones, and satellites based on priority tasks, hazards, and weather conditions.

#### Thought Process:

1. **Identify Key Priorities:**
   - **Rovers:** Focus on seismic sensor deployment and initial sampling of surface materials.
   - **Drones:** Prioritize imaging key geological features and setting up communication relays.
   - **Satellites:** Support communication relay setup and perform imaging tasks from orbit.

2. **Assess Hazards and Constraints:**
   - **Rovers:** Face terrain instability, radiation exposure, extreme temperatures, and weather-related risks.
   - **Drones:** Must navigate high wind speeds, dust storms, temperature extremes, and reduced visibility.
   - **Satellites:** Deal with atmospheric disturbances affecting communication and imaging.

3. **Integrate Weather Insights:**
   - Consider current conditions such as wind intensity, dust storms, temperature ranges, and visibility to adjust operational plans for each crew.

### Final Answer for Task 2:

```json
{
  "rovers": "# Rover-Specific Briefing\n\n## Priorities\n- **Seismic Sensor Deployment**: Essential for understanding geological activity and potential hazards.\n- **Initial Sampling of Surface Materials**: Fundamental for site composition analysis.\n\n## Hazards\n- **Terrain Instability**: Avoid loose soil or steep slopes; use ground-penetrating radar.\n- **Radiation Exposure**: Monitor radiation levels continuously; limit time in high-radiation zones.\n- **Extreme Temperatures**: Operate within equipment and human tolerance limits; use insulated suits if necessary.\n- **Weather-Related Risks**: Plan around weather forecasts; have evacuation plans ready.\n\n## Constraints\n- Avoid unstable terrains for heavy machinery.\n- Continuous radiation monitoring required.\n- Implement cooling measures during extreme heat.",
  "drones": "# Drone-Specific Briefing\n\n## Priorities\n- **Imaging of Key Geological Features**: Provide visual context for target selection.\n- **Communication Relay Setup**: Ensure real-time data transmission and coordination.\n\n## Hazards\n- **Wind Intensity**: High winds may affect stability; limit operations if sustained winds exceed 25 mph.\n- **Dust Storms**: Severe impact on sensor functionality; avoid aerial activities in affected regions.\n- **Extreme Temperatures**: Affect battery performance; schedule flights during cooler parts of the day.\n- **Visibility**: Reduced visibility can compromise navigation systems.\n\n## Constraints\n- Limit operations during peak heat hours (11 AM to 3 PM).\n- Avoid high wind gust areas and dust storm regions.\n- Increase reliance on GPS for navigation in low visibility.",
  "satellites": "# Satellite-Specific Briefing\n\n## Priorities\n- **Communication Relay Setup**: Support real-time data transmission and mission coordination.\n- **Imaging Tasks**: Provide visual context for ground operations.\n\n## Hazards\n- **Radiation Exposure**: Less relevant due to altitude but monitor atmospheric disturbances.\n- **Weather-Related Risks**: Potential impact on ground operations; ensure continuous data flow.\n\n## Constraints\n- Ensure robust communication links despite potential atmospheric interference."
