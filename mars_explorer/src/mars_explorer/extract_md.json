    "Scientific Goals": "- Collect subsurface samples from **rocky** terrain near nodes **N70** and **N102**. \n- Capture panoramic images of **crater** terrain at nodes **N5**, **N58**, **N121** and **N150**. \n- Measure radiation levels in **sandy** terrain at node **N12**, **N86** and **N1**. \n- Deploy seismic sensors at the **rocky** node **N20**. \n- Detect organic molecules in **icy** terrain at **N59**. \n- Air **dust** sample collection during flight over **N33** crater. \n- Map CO2 frost coverage in **icy** areas **N53**, **N63** and **N108**. \n- Identification of thermal anomalies at **icy** nodes **N56** and **N112**.", 
    "Operational Constraints": "- **Rovers** and **drones** should recharge if energy drops below 30%.\\n- **Rovers** must enter a heat shelter during 20 minutes if the surface temperature is below -60ºC.\\n- **Rovers** cannot operate if node temperature is below -80ºC.\\n- **Rover's** energy consumption is different depending on the type of terrain: 5% in rocky, increased 10% in sandy, increased 20% in icy and increased 15% in crater terrains.\\n- **Drones** must return to base after 25 minutes of flight.\\n- **Drones** are disabled if there is a dust storm.\\n- **Drones** cannot operate if wind gusts are higher than 40 km/h.\\n- **Drone's** energy consumption is increased 15% if wind is higher than 30 km/h.\\n- **Satellites** must maintain communication with the base station at N30 or N84 every 5 hours if they have to identify thermal anomalies. \\n- **Satellites** cannot communicate in nodes with communication loss.\\n- **Rovers** may not operate in terrain classified as radioactive.\\n- **Rovers** may not operate in terrain classified as unstable.",
