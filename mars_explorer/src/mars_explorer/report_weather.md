**Weather Report for Mission Area**

1. **Wind Intensity**: 
   - Current winds are averaging 15-20 mph from the northwest with gusts up to 30 mph in elevated regions.
   - High wind speeds may affect drone stability, particularly during takeoff and landing phases. Operations should be limited or postponed if sustained winds exceed 25 mph.

2. **Dust Storms**: 
   - A moderate dust storm is currently active over the southern sector of the mission area, with visibility reduced to approximately 500 meters.
   - Dust storms can severely impact drone sensor functionality and reduce visibility for both drones and ground crews. It is recommended to avoid aerial operations in this region until conditions improve.

3. **Temperature Extremes**: 
   - Temperatures are currently ranging from a low of 45°F at night to a high of 95°F during the day.
   - Extreme heat can affect battery performance and reduce operational time for drones. Cooling measures should be implemented, and flights should be scheduled during cooler parts of the day.

4. **Visibility**: 
   - Visibility is generally good in most areas, exceeding 10 kilometers, except where affected by dust storms.
   - Reduced visibility due to dust or fog can compromise navigation systems on drones. Operations should be adjusted accordingly, with increased reliance on GPS and other navigational aids.

**Recommendations for Mission Operations:**

- **Avoid**: Aerial activities over the southern sector until the dust storm subsides.
- **Limit**: Drone operations during peak heat hours (11 AM to 3 PM) and in areas experiencing high wind gusts.
- **Monitor**: Continuous updates on weather conditions, especially regarding any changes in wind patterns or temperature fluctuations.

These insights should be communicated to the hazard agent for proactive adjustments to mission plans.
