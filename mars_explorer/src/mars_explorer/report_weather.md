**Weather Report for Mission Area**

1. **Wind Intensity**: 
   - Current winds are averaging 15-20 mph from the northwest with gusts up to 30 mph in open areas.
   - High wind speeds may affect drone stability and control, particularly during takeoff and landing phases. Operations should be limited or postponed if sustained winds exceed 25 mph.

2. **Dust Storms**:
   - A moderate dust storm is currently developing over the southern sector of the mission area, with visibility dropping to less than 1 mile.
   - Dust storms can severely impact sensor functionality and reduce visibility for both manned and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). It is recommended to avoid drone flights in this region until conditions improve.

3. **Temperature Extremes**:
   - Daytime temperatures are expected to reach highs of 95°F, with nighttime lows dropping to around 60°F.
   - Extreme heat can affect battery performance and reduce the operational time for drones. Cooling measures should be considered during peak temperature hours. Cold nights may impact equipment that is not adequately insulated.

4. **Visibility**:
   - Visibility is currently at 5 miles in most areas but will decrease significantly in regions affected by dust storms.
   - Reduced visibility can hinder navigation and increase the risk of collisions. Drone operations should be restricted to areas with clear visibility, avoiding sectors where dust storms are active.

**Recommendations for Mission Operations**:
- **Avoidance**: Refrain from conducting drone flights in the southern sector due to developing dust storms and high wind gusts.
- **Limitation**: Limit aerial activities during peak heat hours (12 PM - 4 PM) to prevent overheating of equipment. Consider scheduling operations during early morning or late afternoon when temperatures are more moderate.
- **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor weather updates for changes in wind patterns and dust storm developments, adjusting mission plans accordingly.

**Communication with Hazard Agent**:
- Inform the hazard agent about the potential risks associated with current weather conditions, particularly focusing on areas affected by high winds and dust storms. Highlight the need for proactive adjustments to mission plans to ensure safety and operational efficiency.

This report provides a detailed overview of current and forecasted environmental conditions, identifying specific areas and operations that should be avoided or limited due to weather-related risks.
