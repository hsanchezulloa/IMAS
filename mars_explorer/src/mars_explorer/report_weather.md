**Weather Report for Mission Area**

1. **Wind Intensity**: 
   - Current winds are predominantly from the northwest at 15-20 mph with gusts up to 30 mph in certain areas.
   - High wind speeds may impact drone stability and control, particularly during takeoff and landing phases. Operations should be limited or avoided in regions experiencing gusts above 25 mph.

2. **Dust Storms**:
   - A moderate dust storm is currently active over the northern sector of the mission area, with visibility reduced to approximately 0.5 miles.
   - Dust storms can severely affect sensor performance and reduce visibility for both drones and ground crews. It is recommended to delay aerial operations in this region until conditions improve.

3. **Temperature Extremes**:
   - Temperatures are currently ranging from a low of 45°F at night to a high of 95°F during the day.
   - Extreme temperatures can affect battery performance and equipment functionality. Ensure that drones have adequate thermal protection and consider scheduling flights during cooler parts of the day.

4. **Visibility**:
   - Visibility is generally good, averaging around 10 miles across most of the mission area, except in regions affected by dust storms.
   - Reduced visibility due to dust can hinder navigation and increase the risk of collisions. Aerial operations should be postponed or rerouted away from these areas until visibility improves.

5. **Additional Considerations**:
   - Atmospheric pressure is stable with no significant changes expected in the near term, reducing the likelihood of sudden weather shifts.
   - Humidity levels are low, which may contribute to dust storm formation and persistence.

**Recommendations for Mission Operations**:
- Avoid drone flights in areas experiencing high wind gusts or active dust storms.
- Schedule operations during cooler periods of the day to mitigate temperature-related risks.
- Continuously monitor weather updates for any changes that could impact mission safety and effectiveness.

This report should be communicated to the Hazard Agent to ensure proactive adjustments to mission plans based on these weather-related constraints.
