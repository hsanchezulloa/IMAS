**Weather Report for Mission Area**

1. **Wind Intensity:**
   - Current wind speeds are averaging 15-20 mph with gusts up to 30 mph in certain regions.
   - Areas experiencing sustained winds above 25 mph may pose risks to drone stability and control, particularly for lightweight models.

2. **Dust Storms:**
   - A moderate dust storm is currently affecting the northern sector of the mission area, reducing visibility significantly below 1 mile.
   - Operations in this region should be postponed or limited until conditions improve, as dust can interfere with sensor functionality and reduce drone battery efficiency.

3. **Temperature Extremes:**
   - Daytime temperatures are reaching highs of 95°F (35°C), while nighttime lows drop to around 60°F (15°C).
   - Prolonged exposure to high temperatures may affect electronic components and battery life, necessitating additional cooling measures for equipment.
   - Cold nights could impact drone performance if not properly insulated or pre-warmed.

4. **Visibility:**
   - Visibility is currently reduced in the northern sector due to dust storms but remains clear (10+ miles) in other areas.
   - Reduced visibility can hinder navigation and increase the risk of collisions, particularly for drones relying on visual sensors.

**Recommendations:**

- **Avoid or Limit Operations:** 
  - Northern sector during peak dust storm activity.
  - Areas with wind speeds consistently above 25 mph.

- **Precautionary Measures:**
  - Equip drones with enhanced cooling systems to mitigate high temperature effects.
  - Schedule flights during cooler parts of the day to maximize battery efficiency and equipment performance.
  - Utilize GPS-based navigation systems over visual sensors in low visibility conditions.

This report should be communicated to the Hazard Agent for further risk assessment and mission planning adjustments.
