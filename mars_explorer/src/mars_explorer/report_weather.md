**Weather Report for Mission Area**

**Current Conditions:**
- **Wind Intensity:** Winds are currently moderate at 15-20 mph from the northwest. Gusts up to 30 mph have been recorded in open areas, which could affect drone stability and control.
- **Dust Storms:** A dust storm is developing over the eastern sector of the mission area, with visibility dropping below 500 meters. This poses significant risks for aerial operations due to reduced sensor effectiveness and potential damage to equipment.
- **Temperature Extremes:** Temperatures are currently high, ranging from 35°C during the day to a low of 20°C at night. Prolonged exposure to these conditions may affect battery life and performance of electronic systems on drones.
- **Visibility:** Visibility is generally good in most areas except for those affected by the dust storm. In clear zones, visibility exceeds 10 kilometers.

**Forecasted Conditions:**
- The wind intensity is expected to increase slightly over the next 24 hours, with potential gusts reaching up to 40 mph in exposed regions.
- The dust storm is predicted to move westward, potentially affecting central areas of the mission zone by midday. Visibility could be reduced further during this period.
- Temperatures are forecasted to remain stable, with no significant drops expected overnight.

**Operational Recommendations:**
- **Avoidance:** Aerial operations should avoid the eastern sector where the dust storm is currently active and moving westward. The central area may also become hazardous as the storm progresses.
- **Limitations:** Drone flights in open areas exposed to high winds or gusts should be limited, especially during peak wind periods. Consider scheduling flights during early morning or late evening when temperatures are cooler and winds are calmer.
- **Precautions:** Ensure all drones have adequate cooling systems to handle the high daytime temperatures. Equip drones with enhanced sensor capabilities to mitigate visibility issues in dust-affected zones.

**Communication to Hazard Agent:**
The current weather conditions, particularly the developing dust storm and increasing wind intensity, present significant risks for aerial operations. These factors should be considered when planning mission activities to ensure safety and operational efficiency. Adjustments to flight schedules or routes may be necessary to mitigate these hazards effectively.
