To determine which nodes in the provided graph are base nodes (i.e., have no incoming edges), we need to analyze the structure of the XML content. The XML describes a graph where nodes are connected by directed edges. A node is considered a base node if there are no other nodes with an edge pointing to it.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify Nodes and Edges**:
   - Each `<node>` element represents a node in the graph, identified by its `id` attribute (e.g., `N0`, `N1`, etc.).
   - Each `<edge>` element represents a directed connection from one node to another, specified by `from` and `to` attributes.

2. **Determine Base Nodes**:
   - A base node is defined as having no incoming edges.
   - To find these nodes, we need to check each edge's `to` attribute and determine which nodes are not listed in any `to` attribute across all edges.

3. **Extract Node IDs with No Incoming Edges**:
   - We will iterate through the list of edges and collect all unique node IDs that appear as a destination (`to`) in these edges.
   - Any node ID that does not appear in this collection is a base node, as it has no incoming edges.

### Execution

Let's go through the XML content to identify nodes with no incoming edges:

- **Nodes**: `N0`, `N1`, `N2`, `N3`, `N4`, `N5`, `N6`, `N7`, `N8`, `N9`
- **Edges**:
  - From `N0` to `N1`
  - From `N0` to `N2`
  - From `N1` to `N3`
  - From `N2` to `N3`
  - From `N3` to `N4`
  - From `N4` to `N5`
  - From `N4` to `N6`
  - From `N5` to `N7`
  - From `N6` to `N7`
  - From `N7` to `N8`
  - From `N8` to `N9`

- **Nodes with Incoming Edges**:
  - `N1`: Incoming from `N0`
  - `N2`: Incoming from `N0`
  - `N3`: Incoming from `N1`, `N2`
  - `N4`: Incoming from `N3`
  - `N5`: Incoming from `N4`
  - `N6`: Incoming from `N4`
  - `N7`: Incoming from `N5`, `N6`
  - `N8`: Incoming from `N7`
  - `N9`: Incoming from `N8`

- **Nodes with No Incoming Edges**:
  - `N0` is not listed as a destination in any edge, so it has no incoming edges.

### Final Answer

The node that is a base node (i.e., has no incoming edges) is:

```json
["N0"]
```

This JSON array contains the ID of the node with no incoming edges, fulfilling the requirement to identify base nodes in the graph.
