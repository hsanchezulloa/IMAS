To determine which nodes in the graph are bases for the given set of edges, we need to identify nodes that can reach every other node either directly or indirectly. A base is a node from which all other nodes are accessible through some path.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Nodes: \( N = \{N_0, N_1, N_2, N_3, N_4\} \)
   - Edges: 
     - \( E_0 = (N_0, N_1) \)
     - \( E_1 = (N_1, N_2) \)
     - \( E_2 = (N_2, N_3) \)
     - \( E_3 = (N_3, N_4) \)
     - \( E_4 = (N_4, N_0) \)

   This forms a cycle: \( N_0 \to N_1 \to N_2 \to N_3 \to N_4 \to N_0 \).

2. **Graph Connectivity:**
   - The graph is strongly connected because there is a path from any node to every other node, forming a single cycle.

3. **Identifying Bases:**
   - In a strongly connected directed graph, any node can be considered a base because you can reach all other nodes starting from it.
   - Since the graph forms a cycle, each node has an outgoing edge that eventually leads back to itself through other nodes.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - All nodes \( \{N_0, N_1, N_2, N_3, N_4\} \) are bases because they can reach every other node in the graph.

### Final Answer

```json
{
  "bases": ["N_0", "N_1", "N_2", "N_3", "N_4"]
}
```

This solution confirms that each node in this strongly connected cycle is a base, as they all have paths to every other node.
