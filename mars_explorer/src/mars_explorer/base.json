To determine which nodes are considered "base" or "plain" in the given graph, we need to analyze the terrain types associated with each node. The task involves identifying nodes that have a terrain type of either "base" or "plain." However, from the provided data, it seems there is no explicit mention of any node being labeled as "base." Therefore, our focus will be on identifying nodes with the terrain type "plain."

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Extract Node Information:**
   - We have a list of nodes along with their associated terrain types:
     - N0: plain
     - N1: forest
     - N2: hill
     - N3: plain
     - N4: forest
     - N5: hill
     - N6: plain
     - N7: forest
     - N8: hill

2. **Identify Nodes with Terrain Type "Plain":**
   - From the list, we need to identify nodes that have the terrain type "plain."
   - The nodes with "plain" as their terrain type are:
     - N0
     - N3
     - N6

3. **Consideration for "Base":**
   - There is no explicit mention of any node being labeled as "base." Therefore, we only consider the "plain" terrain type.

4. **Compile Final List:**
   - Based on the analysis, the nodes that are considered "base" or "plain" are N0, N3, and N6.

### Conclusion:

The final answer is a JSON dictionary listing the nodes with the terrain type "plain," as there were no nodes explicitly labeled as "base."

```json
{
  "N0": true,
  "N1": false,
  "N2": false,
  "N3": true,
  "N4": false,
  "N5": false,
  "N6": true,
  "N7": false,
  "N8": false
}
```

This JSON dictionary indicates which nodes are considered "base" or "plain," with `true` representing those that meet the criteria and `false` for those that do not.
