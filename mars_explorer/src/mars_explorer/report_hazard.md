### Hazard Report

#### Dangerous Zones:
1. **Terrain Instability:** Areas with loose soil or steep slopes, recent seismic activity zones, regions near radioactive materials.
2. **Radiation Exposure:** High-altitude areas with increased cosmic radiation exposure.
3. **Extreme Temperatures:** Regions experiencing temperatures beyond equipment and human tolerance limits.
4. **Weather-Related Risks:** Zones prone to severe weather events such as hurricanes, tornadoes, or blizzards.

#### Forbidden Nodes:
1. **Radiation Exposure:** Areas exceeding safe radiation thresholds without protective gear.
2. **Extreme Temperatures:** Locations with no feasible thermal protection for personnel or equipment.
3. **Weather-Related Risks:** Areas forecasted to experience extreme weather conditions during mission operations.

#### Operational Constraints:
1. **Terrain Instability:** Restriction on heavy machinery in unstable terrains; mandatory ground-penetrating radar use.
2. **Radiation Exposure:** Continuous radiation monitoring and dosimeter usage; time limits in high-radiation zones.
3. **Extreme Temperatures:** Requirement of insulated suits and climate-controlled habitats for extreme temperatures.
4. **Weather-Related Risks:** Mission planning around weather forecasts with real-time updates and evacuation plans.

#### Final Recommendations:
- Implement redundant safety systems to ensure mission success despite identified hazards.
- Conduct thorough pre-mission training focused on hazard recognition and response.
- Establish clear communication protocols for reporting hazardous conditions in real-time.
