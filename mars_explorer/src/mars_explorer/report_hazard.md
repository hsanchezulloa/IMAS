The mission hazard report identifies several key environmental hazards and operational constraints that must be respected to ensure crew safety:

1. **Terrain Instability:** Dangerous zones include areas with a history of geological disturbances such as landslides or sinkholes. Operations should avoid these unless reinforced structures are used, and terrain stability monitoring tools are employed.

2. **Radiation Exposure:** Establish safe radiation exposure limits for all personnel, equipped with personal dosimeters. Avoid operations in high-radiation zones unless protective measures are implemented.

3. **Extreme Temperatures:** Define operational temperature thresholds and ensure all personnel have appropriate thermal protection clothing. Equipment must be rated for the expected temperature range.

4. **Weather-Related Risks:** Utilize real-time weather data to avoid adverse conditions. Establish rapid evacuation protocols for sudden weather changes.

**Dangerous Zones and Forbidden Nodes:**
- Dangerous zones include areas with geological instability or high radiation levels.
- Forbidden nodes are locations prone to severe weather events, such as storm paths or flood-prone areas.

**Operational Constraints:**
- Adhere to established radiation exposure limits and temperature thresholds.
- Implement real-time monitoring of terrain stability and weather conditions.
- Ensure redundant safety systems for all critical equipment and personnel gear. 

By respecting these guidelines, the mission can proceed with minimized risk to crew members and equipment.
