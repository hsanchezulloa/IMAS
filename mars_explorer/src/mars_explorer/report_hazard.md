The mission faces several environmental hazards and operational constraints that must be carefully managed to ensure crew safety. Dangerous zones include areas with terrain instability, elevated radiation levels, extreme temperatures, and severe weather conditions. Forbidden nodes are identified as high-risk terrain near cliffs and unstable formations, regions exceeding safe radiation exposure limits, areas with rapid temperature fluctuations beyond equipment tolerance, and locations forecasted for extreme weather events.

Operational constraints necessitate minimizing movement through unstable terrain using specialized equipment, limiting time in radiation zones while equipping crews with dosimeters and protective gear, scheduling operations during moderate temperatures with appropriate thermal protection, and maintaining vigilant monitoring of weather updates with established communication and evacuation protocols. Adhering to these guidelines will help mitigate risks and ensure mission success.
