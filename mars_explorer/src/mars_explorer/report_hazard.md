**Hazard Report**

- **Dangerous Zones:** 
  - Areas with potential for terrain instability due to loose soil or seismic activity.
  - Regions with elevated radiation levels identified through monitoring equipment.
  - Locations experiencing extreme temperature variations based on climate data.
  - Zones prone to severe weather events as indicated by forecasts and historical patterns.

- **Forbidden Nodes:**
  - Specific areas where combined environmental hazards exceed safe operational limits, including high radiation zones and regions susceptible to landslides or severe storms.

- **Operational Constraints:**
  - Implement redundancy in equipment and procedures.
  - Train crew on hazard recognition and emergency response.
  - Maintain clear communication for real-time updates on conditions.
  - Limit exposure time in high-risk areas and enforce safety guidelines strictly. 

By adhering to these assessments, the mission can proceed with minimized risk to personnel and equipment.
