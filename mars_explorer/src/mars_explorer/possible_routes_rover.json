Based on the analysis of the provided data, here's an organized summary of each rover's capabilities and potential strategies:

### Rover Analysis:
1. **Rover 1 (N30):**
   - Reachable Nodes: N70, N12, N20
   - Energy Levels:
     - N70: 33.33 (BATTERY OK)
     - N12: 3.65 (WARNING: Low battery)
     - N20: 28.77 (WARNING: Low battery)

2. **Rover 2 (N84):**
   - Reachable Nodes: N70, N102, N86, N59
   - Energy Levels:
     - N70: 87.85 (BATTERY OK)
     - N102: 37.98 (BATTERY OK)
     - N86: 87.85 (BATTERY OK)
     - N59: 16.45 (WARNING: Low battery)

3. **Rover 3 (N30):**
   - Reachable Nodes: N70, N12, N20
   - Energy Levels:
     - N70: 33.33 (BATTERY OK)
     - N12: 3.65 (WARNING: Low battery)
     - N20: 28.77 (WARNING: Low battery)

4. **Rover 4 (N84):**
   - Reachable Nodes: N70, N102, N86, N59
   - Energy Levels:
     - N70: 37.33 (BATTERY OK)
     - N102: 23.98 (WARNING: Low battery)
     - N86: 73.85 (BATTERY OK)
     - N59: 2.45 (WARNING: Low battery)

### Key Observations:
- **Critical Nodes:** N70, N102, N86 are reachable by multiple rovers with sufficient energy.
- **Energy Concerns:** Some paths to nodes like N12, N20, and N59 have very low energy levels, indicating potential risks if these nodes are critical.
- **Path Redundancy:** Routes often loop back to the starting node (e.g., N84), which might allow for battery recharging or strategic planning.

### Potential Strategies:
1. **Task Allocation:**
   - Assign tasks based on each rover's strengths. For example, Rover 2 and Rover 4 at N84 can handle longer distances with better energy reserves.
   
2. **Battery Management:**
   - Prioritize nodes requiring minimal energy first to avoid depleting batteries on non-critical tasks.

3. **Backup Routes:**
   - Use multiple rovers for critical nodes to ensure redundancy and minimize risk of mission failure due to low battery issues.

4. **Recharging Plan:**
   - If possible, plan routes that allow rovers to return to base (N84 or N30) for recharging before attempting high-energy tasks.

### Conclusion:
The optimal strategy involves leveraging each rover's capabilities while managing energy resources carefully. Assigning critical missions to rovers with sufficient battery life and planning for potential recharging stops can enhance mission success.
