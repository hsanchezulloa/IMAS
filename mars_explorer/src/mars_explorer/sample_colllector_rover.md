# Rover Sampling Procedures

## 1. Collect Subsurface Samples from Rocky Terrain near Nodes N70 and N102

### Step-by-Step Procedure:

1. **Pre-Flight Check**: Ensure all rover systems are operational, including drilling tools, sample containers, and navigation sensors.
2. **Navigation to Node N70**: Use GPS coordinates to navigate to node N70, avoiding obstacles in rocky terrain.
3. **Drill Initialization**: Engage the drill at a low speed to penetrate the rocky surface without causing damage.
4. **Sample Collection**: Collect subsurface samples from a depth of 50 cm using the coring drill. Store samples in labeled containers.
5. **Data Logging**: Record geological data, including rock composition and layer thickness.
6. **Navigation to Node N102**: Traverse safely to node N102, ensuring stability on uneven terrain.
7. **Repeat Sampling at N102**: Perform steps 3-5 again for subsurface samples at node N102.
8. **Post-Sampling Check**: Inspect the drill for any wear and ensure no contamination of samples.
9. **Return to Base or Next Task**: Navigate back to base or proceed to next assignment as directed.
10. **Data Transfer**: Transmit collected data and samples to the central station for analysis.

## 2. Measure Radiation Levels in Sandy Terrain at Nodes N12, N86, and N1

### Step-by-Step Procedure:

1. **Pre-Flight Check**: Verify radiation sensors are functioning and rover is equipped for sandy terrain navigation.
2. **Navigation to Node N12**: Use coordinates to reach node N12, adjusting speed for soft sand.
3. **Radiation Measurement**: Deploy the radiation sensor probe at ground level and record readings.
4. **Data Logging**: Note environmental factors like temperature and humidity alongside measurements.
5. **Navigation to Node N86**: Safely move rover to node N86, avoiding sand traps.
6. **Repeat Radiation Check**: Perform steps 3-4 again for node N86.
7. **Navigation to Node N1**: Proceed to node N1, ensuring stability on uneven ground.
8. **Final Radiation Check**: Conduct measurements and log data at node N1.
9. **Return to Base or Next Task**: Navigate back or proceed as directed.
10. **Data Transfer**: Send radiation data to the central station for analysis.

## 3. Deploy Seismic Sensors at Rocky Node N20

### Step-by-Step Procedure:

1. **Pre-Flight Check**: Ensure seismic sensors and deployment tools are operational.
2. **Navigation to Node N20**: Navigate to node N20, positioning rover stably on rocky terrain.
3. **Sensor Deployment**: Attach seismic sensor to the designated anchor point at node N20.
4. **Calibration**: Calibrate sensor settings for accurate data collection.
5. **Data Logging**: Record initial readings and environmental conditions.
6. **Secure Connection**: Ensure the sensor is securely anchored against rover movement.
7. **Post-Deployment Check**: Verify sensor functionality and record any anomalies.
8. **Return to Base or Next Task**: Navigate back or proceed as instructed.
9. **Data Transfer**: Transmit deployment data to central station.
10. **Final Review**: Confirm all steps completed successfully.

## 4. Detect Organic Molecules in Icy Terrain at Node N59

### Step-by-Step Procedure:

1. **Pre-Flight Check**: Ensure organic molecule sensor and ice drilling tools are functional.
2. **Navigation to Node N59**: Use coordinates to reach node N59, adjusting for icy terrain.
3. **Ice Penetration**: Use a high-frequency drill to penetrate the ice layer without melting it.
4. **Sample Collection**: Collect ice core samples at specified depths and store in containers.
5. **Sensor Activation**: Activate organic molecule sensor to analyze collected samples on-site.
6. **Data Logging**: Record sensor readings and sample conditions.
7. **Post-Analysis Check**: Ensure no cross-contamination occurred during collection.
8. **Return to Base or Next Task**: Navigate back or proceed as directed.
9. **Sample Transfer**: Send samples and data to the central station for further analysis.
10. **Final Review**: Confirm all procedures followed correctly.

# Notes:
- Each procedure is designed for a specific terrain type (rocky, sandy, icy) and target node.
- Ensure rover safety by avoiding sharp rocks, deep sand, or unstable ice during operations.
- Maintain communication with the central station for real-time updates and instructions.
