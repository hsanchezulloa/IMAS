## 1. Radiation Levels Measurement in Sandy Terrain

### Step-by-Step Procedure:

1. **Pre-Flight Check**: Conduct a thorough system check of all rover instruments, including the radiation detection sensors.
2. **Navigation to Node N12**: Traverse from the current position to node N12 using pre-mapped routes.
3. **Deployment Preparation**: Ensure the radiation sensor is properly calibrated and ready for deployment.
4. **Radiation Measurement at N12**: Deploy the sensor on the surface of the sandy terrain and record radiation levels.
5. **Data Recording**: Store the collected data in the rover's memory unit with timestamp and location coordinates.
6. **Navigation to Node N86**: Move from N12 to N86, ensuring minimal disturbance to the surrounding environment.
7. **Radiation Measurement at N86**: Repeat the measurement process as done for N12.
8. **Data Recording**: Save the data with appropriate metadata.
9. **Navigation to Node N1**: Proceed to node N1 while avoiding obstacles and maintaining communication links.
10. **Final Radiation Measurement**: Conduct the final measurement at N1, then return to base for data analysis.

## 2. Seismic Sensor Deployment in Rocky Terrain (High Priority)

### Step-by-Step Procedure:

1. **Pre-Deployment Check**: Inspect seismic sensors and deployment tools for functionality.
2. **Navigation to Node N20**: Traverse to node N20, ensuring stability on rocky terrain.
3. **Sensor Setup**: Securely anchor the seismic sensor in a stable position at node N20.
4. **Initial Data Collection**: Begin collecting baseline seismic data immediately after deployment.
5. **Mark Deployment Location**: Use GPS coordinates and visual markers to record the deployment site.
6. **Secure Equipment**: Ensure all equipment is locked down against potential environmental hazards.
7. **Post-Deployment Check**: Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and transmitting data.
8. **Return Path Planning**: Plot the return route, avoiding recent terrain changes.
9. **Navigation Back to Base**: Safely navigate back to the rover's base station.
10. **Data Transfer**: Upload collected data to the central database for analysis.

## 3. Organic Molecules Detection in Icy Terrain

### Step-by-Step Procedure:

1. **Instrument Calibration**: Calibrate organic molecule detection instruments before deployment.
2. **Navigation to Node N59**: Traverse to node N59, navigating carefully over icy terrain.
3. **Sample Collection Readiness**: Ensure the spectrometer and collection tools are ready for use.
4. **Surface Analysis**: Use the spectrometer to scan the surface for signs of organic molecules.
5. **Core Sample Extraction**: If organics detected, extract a core sample using the coring drill.
6. **Sample Handling**: Store collected samples in sealed containers to prevent contamination.
7. **Data Logging**: Record all findings and spectra data with precise timestamps.
8. **Environmental Monitoring**: Check surrounding conditions for any environmental changes.
9. **Return Navigation**: Plan and execute return path, ensuring sample integrity.
10. **Transfer Samples**: Deliver samples to the lab for further analysis upon return.
