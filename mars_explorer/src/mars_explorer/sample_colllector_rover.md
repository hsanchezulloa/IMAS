# Rover Sampling Procedures

## Procedure 1: Collect Subsurface Samples from Rocky Terrain near Nodes N70, N102, and N152

### Objective:
To collect subsurface samples from rocky terrain near nodes N70, N102, and N152.

### Equipment Needed:
- Coring drill
- Sample containers (sterile)
- Ground-penetrating radar (GPR)
- GPS navigation system
- Radiation shielding for samples

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Conduct a Pre-Mission System Check**: Ensure all rover systems are operational, including the coring drill, GPR, and sample storage units.

2. **Navigate to Node N70 Using GPS**: Drive the rover to the coordinates of node N70, ensuring safe traversal over rocky terrain.

3. **Use Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR)**: Deploy GPR to identify subsurface features and determine optimal sampling locations.

4. **Deploy the Coring Drill at Identified Points**: Position the coring drill at the determined points and initiate drilling to collect core samples.

5. **Collect Samples into Sterile Containers**: Transfer the collected cores into sterile containers to preserve sample integrity.

6. **Seal and Secure Sample Containers**: Ensure containers are sealed properly to prevent contamination and secure them in the rover's storage compartment.

7. **Log Data and Take Photos**: Record data from GPR, note sampling locations, and take high-resolution images of the area.

8. **Return to Start Point**: Safely navigate back to the starting point or proceed to the next node.

9. **Repeat for Nodes N102 and N152**: Follow steps 2-8 for nodes N102 and N152, ensuring consistency in sampling procedures.

10. **Post-Mission Review**: Upon completion, review all data and samples collected, ensuring no anomalies or issues were encountered during the mission.
