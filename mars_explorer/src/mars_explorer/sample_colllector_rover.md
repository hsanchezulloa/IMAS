# Rover Sampling Protocol Document

## 1. Collect Subsurface Samples from Rocky Terrain near Nodes N70 and N102

### Step-by-Step Procedure:

1. **Conduct Pre-Flight Rover Check**: Ensure all rover systems are operational, including navigation, drilling, and sample collection mechanisms.
2. **Navigate to Node N70**: Use GPS coordinates to travel to the designated rocky terrain area near node N70.
3. **Locate Sampling Site**: Identify the optimal location for subsurface sampling based on geological features observed via rover cameras.
4. **Deploy Drilling Mechanism**: Activate the drilling tool to penetrate the rocky surface and collect subsurface samples.
5. **Collect Sample 1**: Retrieve a core sample from the drilled site and store it in the sample container.
6. **Analyze Sample On-Site**: Use onboard spectrometers to identify key elements and minerals in the collected sample.
7. **Navigate to Node N102**: Travel to the next sampling location near node N102, maintaining a safe distance from obstacles.
8. **Repeat Sampling Process**: Perform steps 4-6 at node N102 to collect a second subsurface sample.
9. **Return to Base Station**: Safely navigate back to the rover's base station with collected samples and data.
10. **Upload Data and Samples**: Transfer all collected data and samples to the main database for further analysis.
