## 1. Measure Radiation Levels in Sandy Terrain at Nodes N12, N86, and N1

### Step-by-Step Procedure:

1. **Rover Navigation**: The rover will navigate to node N12 using pre-mission maps and GPS guidance.
2. **Terrain Assessment**: Upon arrival, the rover will assess the sandy terrain for any obstacles or uneven surfaces.
3. **Sensor Deployment**: Deploy the radiation sensor module on the surface of the sandy terrain at node N12.
4. **Data Collection**: Collect continuous radiation level data for 30 minutes, recording peak and baseline levels.
5. **Sample Collection**: If required, collect a soil sample from the immediate vicinity for further analysis.
6. **Rover Movement**: Safely move to node N86 following the same procedure as above.
7. **Repeat Process**: Perform steps 2-5 at node N86.
8. **Proceed to Node N1**: Navigate to node N1, ensuring no terrain-related issues arise during transit.
9. **Final Radiation Check**: Conduct a thorough radiation assessment and data collection at node N1.
10. **Data Transmission**: Transmit all collected data back to the mission control center for analysis.

### Notes:
- Ensure all movements are logged for future reference.
- Monitor rover health throughout the operation.
