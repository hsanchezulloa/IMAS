# Rover Sampling Procedures

## 1. Collect Subsurface Samples from Rocky Terrain near Nodes N70 and N102

### Step-by-Step Procedure:
1. **Navigate to Node N70**: Use GPS coordinates to reach the designated node on rocky terrain.
2. **Assess Surroundings**: Conduct a visual inspection for obstacles or hazards.
3. **Deploy Sampling Arm**: Extend the sampling arm to access subsurface materials.
4. **Initiate Core Sampling**: Use the coring drill to extract subsurface samples.
5. **Capture Sample Images**: Take high-resolution images of the sample area.
6. **Store Samples**: Transfer samples into airtight containers for preservation.
7. **Repeat at Node N102**: Follow steps 1-6 at node N102.
8. **Document Findings**: Record data on sample location and condition.
9. **Return to Base**: Safely navigate back to the rover's base station.
10. **Final Check**: Ensure all samples are secure and equipment is operational.

## 2. Measure Radiation Levels in Sandy Terrain at Nodes N12, N86, and N1

### Step-by-Step Procedure:
1. **Travel to Node N12**: Use navigation systems to reach the sandy node.
2. **Set Up Radiation Sensors**: Deploy sensors on the terrain surface.
3. **Collect Data**: Measure radiation levels over a specified period.
4. **Record Results**: Document readings and environmental conditions.
5. **Repeat at Node N86**: Follow steps 1-4 at node N86.
6. **Proceed to Node N1**: Repeat steps 1-4 at node N1.
7. **Analyze Data**: Compare radiation levels across nodes.
8. **Report Findings**: Transmit data to the control center.
9. **Secure Equipment**: Store sensors safely post-measurement.
10. **Conduct Safety Check**: Ensure no contamination or malfunctions.

## 3. Deploy Seismic Sensors at Rocky Node N20

### Step-by-Step Procedure:
1. **Reach Node N20**: Navigate to the specified rocky location.
2. **Prepare Deployment Area**: Clear any debris around the deployment site.
3. **Set Up Sensor Array**: Position seismic sensors in a grid pattern.
4. **Calibrate Sensors**: Ensure accurate data collection settings.
5. **Activate Monitoring Mode**: Start real-time data acquisition.
6. **Capture Environmental Data**: Record baseline conditions.
7. **Secure Connections**: Confirm all sensors are functioning.
8. **Document Deployment**: Log sensor positions and status.
9. **Return to Rover Base**: After deployment, head back.
10. **Conduct Post-Deployment Check**: Verify ongoing data transmission.

## 4. Detect Organic Molecules in Icy Terrain at Node N59

### Step-by-Step Procedure:
1. **Travel to Node N59**: Use navigation systems to reach the icy node.
2. **Prepare Sampling Tools**: Ensure spectrometer and drills are ready.
3. **Collect Surface Samples**: Gather samples from the icy terrain.
4. **Analyze Samples**: Use a spectrometer to detect organic molecules.
5. **Document Results**: Record any positive findings and conditions.
6. **Store Samples Securely**: Preserve samples for further analysis.
7. **Conduct Safety Check**: Ensure no equipment damage or malfunctions.
8. **Return to Rover Base**: Safely navigate back.
9. ** Transmit Data**: Send findings to the control center.
10. **Prepare Final Report**: Summarize organic molecule detection.
