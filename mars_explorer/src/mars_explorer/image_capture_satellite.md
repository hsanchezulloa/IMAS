### Satellite Mission Execution Protocols

#### **Mission Type: Panoramic Image Capture at Crater Nodes**

**1. Sensor Initialization**
   - Power on and initialize imaging sensors.
   - Calibrate cameras for optimal clarity.

**2. Positioning**
   - Adjust satellite orientation to face the target node (N5, N58, N121, or N150).
   - Ensure optimal angle for panoramic coverage.

**3. Capture Sequence**
   - Use wide-angle lens for comprehensive crater views.
   - Capture multiple images to ensure full coverage.

**4. Data Validation**
   - Review each image for clarity and completeness.
   - Retake if necessary to avoid missing any details.

**5. Transmission**
   - Transmit data within the specified communication window:
     - N121: 3h
     - N58: 4h
     - N5: 7h
     - N150: 5h (Note: Be prepared for potential retransmission due to node issues.)

#### **Mission Type: Thermal Anomaly Detection at Icy Nodes**

**1. Sensor Initialization**
   - Activate thermal imaging sensors.
   - Set parameters for detecting temperature variations.

**2. Positioning**
   - Align satellite over the target node (N56 or N112).
   - Adjust altitude to optimize thermal data capture.

**3. Capture Sequence**
   - Use infrared sensors to capture thermal data at specified intervals.
   - Focus on identifying temperature anomalies indicative of thermal activity.

**4. Data Validation**
   - Analyze thermal data for unusual hotspots or patterns.
   - Repeat captures if anomalies are detected but unclear.

**5. Transmission**
   - Transmit data within the 7h communication window for both nodes.
   - Ensure all thermal data is included in transmission.

### Notes:
- **Communication Loss Nodes:** Be aware of potential issues with N150 and ensure contingency plans for data retransmission if necessary.
- **Terrain Considerations:** Adjust satellite positioning based on terrain type (crater vs. icy) to optimize sensor effectiveness.
