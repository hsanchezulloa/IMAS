#### Protocol 1: Panoramic Image Capture of Crater Terrain

**Objective:** Capture high-resolution panoramic images of crater terrain at designated nodes.

**Steps:**

1. **Sensor Initialization:**
   - Power on the satellite's optical camera system.
   - Ensure panoramic imaging mode is activated and configured for wide-angle capture.

2. **Positioning:**
   - Adjust satellite orientation to ensure the camera faces the target crater area directly.
   - Maintain stable altitude above the designated node (e.g., N5, N58, N121, N150) to ensure optimal image quality.

3. **Capture Sequence:**
   - Initiate panoramic imaging sequence over the assigned node.
   - Capture multiple high-resolution images, ensuring full coverage of the crater terrain.

4. **Data Validation:**
   - Review captured images for clarity and completeness.
   - Adjust exposure settings if necessary to enhance image quality.

5. **Transmission:**
   - Compress and encrypt the image data.
   - Transmit the validated images to Earth or the control center via designated communication channels.

#### Protocol 2: Thermal Anomaly Identification on Icy Nodes

**Objective:** Detect and monitor thermal anomalies at icy surface nodes.

**Steps:**

1. **Sensor Initialization:**
   - Activate the satellite's thermal imaging sensor.
   - Calibrate the sensor to account for extreme cold conditions on icy terrain.

2. **Positioning:**
   - Position the satellite directly above the assigned icy node (e.g., N56, N112).
   - Ensure optimal altitude and orientation for accurate thermal data collection.

3. **Capture Sequence:**
   - Begin continuous thermal imaging over the target node.
   - Collect temperature readings at regular intervals to monitor surface activity.

4. **Data Validation:**
   - Analyze thermal data for anomalies, such as unusual hotspots or temperature fluctuations.
   - Cross-reference with historical data if necessary.

5. **Transmission:**
   - Format thermal data and coordinates for transmission.
   - Send validated data to Earth or the control center via secure communication links.
