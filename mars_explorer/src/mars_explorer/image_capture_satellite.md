### Satellite Mission Execution Protocols

#### 1. Panoramic Terrain Capture at Crater Nodes (N5, N58, N121, N150)

**Step 1: Sensor Initialization**
- **Action**: Activate the multispectral camera suite, ensuring all bands are operational.
- **Details**: Set exposure parameters for optimal image capture in crater terrain. Adjust white balance and focus settings to account for varying lighting conditions.

**Step 2: Positioning**
- **Action**: Manually adjust satellite orbit to align with target nodes N5, N58, N121, and N150.
- **Details**: Ensure altitude is set between 150-200 km for high-resolution imaging. Orient the camera nadir towards the terrain.

**Step 3: Capture Sequence**
- **Action**: Initiate panoramic image capture sequence.
- **Details**: Capture a series of overlapping images in RGB, near-infrared, and thermal bands. Use panning commands to cover all nodes within a 10-minute window.

**Step 4: Data Validation**
- **Action**: Review captured data for completeness and quality.
- **Details**: Check image alignment, coverage, and clarity. Compare against predefined criteria for acceptable resolution and contrast.

**Step 5: Transmission**
- **Action**: Transmit validated images to ground control via secure communication channel.
- **Details**: Prioritize transmission based on mission criticality. Include metadata such as timestamp, node coordinates, and sensor settings.

#### 2. Thermal Anomaly Identification at Icy Nodes (N56, N112)

**Step 1: Sensor Initialization**
- **Action**: Activate the thermal infrared sensor.
- **Details**: Set sensitivity to detect temperature variations in icy terrain. Adjust gain and offset parameters for optimal signal capture.

**Step 2: Positioning**
- **Action**: Fine-tune satellite orbit for precise alignment with target nodes N56 and N112.
- **Details**: Maintain altitude between 100-150 km to achieve sufficient resolution for thermal analysis. Adjust orientation for nadir viewing.

**Step 3: Capture Sequence**
- **Action**: Begin thermal anomaly detection sequence.
- **Details**: Capture high-resolution thermal images during both day and night cycles. Use automated tracking to focus on target areas.

**Step 4: Data Validation**
- **Action**: Analyze thermal data for anomalies.
- **Details**: Compare captured temperatures against baseline data. Identify deviations indicative of thermal anomalies, such as hotspots or unusual patterns.

**Step 5: Transmission**
- **Action**: Transmit identified anomalies and supporting data to ground control.
- **Details**: Include coordinates, temperature readings, and timestamped images. Prioritize transmission based on anomaly severity.

### Notes:
- **Terrain Considerations**: Adjust sensor parameters based on terrain type (e.g., crater vs. icy) to optimize image quality and anomaly detection.
- **Time Window**: Capture sequences should be scheduled during optimal lighting conditions for panoramic imaging and during thermal activity peaks for anomaly detection.

This protocol ensures precise execution of satellite missions, maximizing data quality and mission success.
