### Satellite Mission Execution Protocols

#### 1. Panoramic Image Capture of Crater Terrain
**Mission Overview:** Capture high-resolution panoramic images of crater terrain at nodes N5, N58, N121, and N150.

**Step-by-Step Protocol:**

1. **Sensor Initialization:**
   - Power up the multi-spectral camera.
   - Ensure sensor calibration is complete for optimal image quality.

2. **Positioning:**
   - Manually or autonomously position the satellite over each target node (N5, N58, N121, N150).
   - Adjust altitude to ensure a wide-angle view of the crater terrain.

3. **Capture Sequence:**
   - Initiate panoramic image capture in sequence for each node.
   - Capture multiple high-resolution images to cover the entire crater area.

4. **Data Validation:**
   - Check each image for clarity and coverage using automated software.
   - Verify that all craters are fully captured within the image set.

5. **Transmission:**
   - Transmit validated images to ground control via satellite link.
   - Store images in buffer if transmission is interrupted; resume upon re-establishment of communication.

#### 2. Thermal Anomaly Identification at Icy Nodes
**Mission Overview:** Identify thermal anomalies at icy nodes N56 and N112.

**Step-by-Step Protocol:**

1. **Sensor Initialization:**
   - Activate the thermal imager.
   - Set sensor parameters to detect temperature variations in icy terrains.

2. **Positioning:**
   - Use auto-targeting system to align with each target node (N56, N112).
   - Ensure precise positioning over the target area for accurate data capture.

3. **Capture Sequence:**
   - Acquire multiple thermal images during a specified time window.
   - Capture images at intervals to monitor temperature fluctuations.

4. **Data Validation:**
   - Analyze images for anomalies using thermal detection algorithms.
   - Flag any unusual temperature spikes or patterns as potential anomalies.

5. **Transmission:**
   - Transmit validated data to ground control immediately after capture.
   - Buffer and retry transmission if communication is lost during the process.
