# Satellite Imaging Execution Protocol Manual

## Mission Type: Panoramic Image Capture of Crater Terrain

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Sensor Initialization:**
   - Power up the satellite's high-resolution camera system.
   - Ensure multispectral sensors are operational for detailed imaging.

2. **Positioning:**
   - Adjust satellite altitude to optimal position (e.g., 50 km) for crater detail.
   - Time window: Capture during midday to avoid shadows, ensuring consistent lighting conditions.

3. **Capture Sequence:**
   - Use panchromatic sensor for high-resolution images.
   - Employ color sensors to capture visual data for context.
   - Stitch images together using onboard software to create panoramic views of nodes N5, N58, N121, and N150.

4. **Data Validation:**
   - Check each image for clarity and absence of motion blur.
   - Ensure all specified crater areas are covered without gaps.

5. **Transmission:**
   - Compress validated data to reduce transmission time.
   - Encrypt sensitive information before sending via designated communication channels.

## Mission Type: Thermal Anomaly Identification at Icy Nodes

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Sensor Initialization:**
   - Activate thermal imaging sensors for infrared detection.
   - Ensure sensors are calibrated for icy surface conditions.

2. **Positioning:**
   - Position satellite over icy nodes N56 and N112 at optimal altitude (e.g., 30 km).
   - Time window: Nighttime or calm periods to minimize atmospheric interference.

3. **Capture Sequence:**
   - Use thermal bands to scan for temperature anomalies.
   - Capture sequential images to track potential hotspots over time.

4. **Data Validation:**
   - Compare captured data against baseline temperatures.
   - Identify and flag any significant deviations as potential anomalies.

5. **Transmission:**
   - Prioritize transmission of anomaly data with high urgency.
   - Transmit all thermal imaging data for further analysis on Earth.
