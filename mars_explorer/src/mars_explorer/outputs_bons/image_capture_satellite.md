### Satellite Mission Execution Protocols

#### Protocol 1: Panoramic Image Capture for Crater Terrain

**Step 1: Sensor Initialization**
- **Action**: Activate the high-resolution optical camera sensor on the satellite imaging system.
- **Details**: Ensure the camera is calibrated and focused for maximum resolution, suitable for capturing detailed crater features.

**Step 2: Positioning Over Target Node**
- **Action**: Manually or autonomously position the satellite directly above the specified crater node (e.g., N5, N73).
- **Details**: Use thrusters to adjust altitude and orientation, ensuring stable positioning over the target area.

**Step 3: Capture Sequence Execution**
- **Action**: Initiate panoramic image capture sequence.
- **Details**: Program the camera to take multiple high-resolution images at varying angles (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) to create a comprehensive panorama of the crater terrain.

**Step 4: Data Validation**
- **Action**: Review captured images for clarity and completeness.
- **Details**: Check each image for proper exposure, focus, and coverage of the target area. Ensure no data loss or corruption during capture.

**Step 5: Data Transmission**
- **Action**: Transmit validated panoramic image data to ground control station.
- **Details**: Use satellite communication systems to send data in encrypted format, ensuring reliable transmission without interference.

#### Protocol 2: Thermal Anomaly Identification for Icy Nodes

**Step 1: Sensor Initialization**
- **Action**: Activate the thermal imaging sensor on the satellite system.
- **Details**: Ensure the sensor is operational and calibrated to detect temperature variations accurately.

**Step 2: Positioning Over Target Node**
- **Action**: Manually or autonomously position the satellite above each icy node (e.g., N56, N112).
- **Details**: Adjust altitude and orientation for optimal thermal data capture, considering atmospheric conditions.

**Step 3: Capture Sequence Execution**
- **Action**: Initiate thermal anomaly detection sequence.
- **Details**: Program the sensor to scan the target area in a grid pattern, capturing temperature readings at specified intervals.

**Step 4: Data Validation**
- **Action**: Analyze captured thermal data for anomalies.
- **Details**: Use algorithms to identify unusual temperature fluctuations indicative of thermal anomalies. Compare against baseline data for accuracy.

**Step 5: Data Transmission**
- **Action**: Transmit validated thermal anomaly data to ground control station.
- **Details**: Send data securely, ensuring integrity and timely receipt by mission scientists for further analysis.
