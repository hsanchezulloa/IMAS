It is impossible to assign all target nodes under the given constraints. Specifically, node N150 cannot be assigned because its only covering satellite must be placed in a communication-loss node, which violates the rules. Therefore, the assignment is as follows, excluding N150:

- **N5:** Assigned to Satellite_0 at location N5.
- **N121:** Assigned to Satellite_2 at location N121.
- **N112:** Assigned to Satellite_5 at location N112.
- **N56:** Assigned to Satellite_4 at location N56.
- **N58:** Assigned to Satellite_1 at location N58.

**Note:** Node N150 remains unassigned due to constraints.
